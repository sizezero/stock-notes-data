global business that designs, manufactures and sells critical equipment for the energy, defense and chemical/petrochemical industries. Energy markets include oil refining, cogeneration, nuclear and alternative power. For the defense industry, our equipment is used in nuclear propulsion power systems for the U.S. Navy. Grahamâ€™s global brand is built upon our world-renowned engineering expertise in vacuum and heat transfer technology, responsive and flexible service and unsurpassed quality. We design and manufacture custom-engineered ejectors, vacuum pumping systems, surface condensers and vacuum systems. We are also a leading nuclear code accredited fabrication and specialty machining company. We supply components used inside reactor vessels and outside containment vessels of nuclear power facilities. Our equipment can also be found in other diverse applications such as metal refining, pulp and paper processing, water heating, refrigeration, desalination, food processing, pharmaceutical, heating, ventilating and air conditioning.

"""
The recent precipitous reduction in global cost for crude oil has caused a significant slowdown in investment by our oil refining and chemical industry customers, especially compared to 12 to 18 months earlier. These markets appear to be in a contraction due to the rapid change in the cost of crude oil. The timing of the recovery is uncertain and will depend upon the future price of crude oil which is currently depressed. Within the nuclear utility market, demand is affected by investment in maintenance, repair, life extension and nuclear regulatory mandated investment along with global investment in new capacity. We continue to view this market as providing steady growth.
"""

"""
In reaction to the slowdown in the energy markets, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we implemented a cost reduction program that included a voluntary early retirement program as well as additional headcount reductions. The impact of this restructuring program was to reduce our headcount by 10% and eliminate $3,000 in annual costs. The cost reductions will be fully implemented by the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Dip in 2009, 2010 could be due to financial crisis (large orders lag).  Currently company is warning about oil crisis which may cause a couple years of bad earnings and offer a buying oportunity.
