Doesn't really matter as these are such inconsistent earnings.

Huge revenue falloff.  Much of the past performance seems to be due to a new regulation requirement for Jan 2005.  New orders are slow because of the recent forced upgrade.

Last dividend was in 2020. It was either a one time or they stopped it.

It hasn't really done much in all this time. I could do some research to see if there is a catalyst but it doesn't look worth it, especially at this valuation.
