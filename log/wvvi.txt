dec quarter looks like the big one revenue-wise.  Maybe they sell some of their grapes.

Has own vinyards (85% of max production) but also buys grapes from neighboring vinyards.  Soil and climate in southern OR is good for grapes but unexpected rains can ruin harvests.  Phylloxera (an aphid like insect) caused problems in the past but now seems to be handled.

Even if the wine is fantastic, weather and grape supply severely limits overall growth.  I don't see this company worth looking at unless the PE drops severely.  Target buy at a PE of 8.

Owns leases vinyards, also buys grapes from the region.  Sells premium, super premium and ultra premium.

"""
Because of climate, soil and other growing conditions, the Willamette Valley in western Oregon is ideally suited to growing superior quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Riesling wine grapes. Some of Oregon’s Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay wines have developed outstanding reputations, winning numerous national and international awards.

Oregon does have certain disadvantages as a new wine-producing region. Oregon’s wines are relatively little known to consumers worldwide and the total wine production of Oregon wineries is small relative to California and French competitors. Greater worldwide label recognition and larger production levels give Oregon’s competitors certain financial, marketing, distribution and unit cost advantages.

Phylloxera an aphid like insect migrating from CA is a risk.

Compare these numbers to 10 year note (1.9%) and each other.

Unless the wine is great, I don't see any kind of moat.

Valuation is wacky but may be justified by growth.  Don't even watch.
