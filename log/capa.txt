$100 to $500 MC

Makes business information delivery systems (faxes, email) over window
systems using .NET.  Reduced revenues; struggling for profitablility.
Huge market cap for this kind of company.

CEO pulls in $375K for a company that has been losing money for years.

More or less flat revenue at $21M.  Still losing money the last three
quarters.  Stock is down to 4 but MC still high at 113M

From 10Q:
2005 Authorized repurchase of $15M in stock.

The company is located in Bellevue so if I have any interest they
would be easy to contact.  I guess salaries + MS centric solution is
turning me off.
