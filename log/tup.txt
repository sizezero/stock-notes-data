Steve pointed this company out due to it's consistent earnings and high yield dividend.

The Company manufactures and distributes the following products primarily through independent direct sales consultants: (1) food storage, preparation and serving containers, kitchen gadgets, microwave cookware and educational toys marketed under the Tupperware brand worldwide, and organized into four geographic segments, (2) premium cosmetics and skin care products marketed under the BeautiControl brand in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and (3) beauty and personal care products mainly in Latin America and Asia Pacific under the brand names House of Fuller, Nutrimetics, NaturCare, Avroy Schlain and Nuvo Cosmeticos.

No patents and few trademarks.

Sales are global with Europe steadily rising and North America steadily declining for roughly flat revenues.  Margins are significantly higher in Europe.  If the company could make inroads into Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia they could generate some significant growth.  I'm a little worried that the decline in North American sales are a symptom of product problems e.g. the new disposable nature of tupperware competition (gladware)

Been giving quarterly divideds of $0.88 per share since 1996.  This dividend was 35% of the trailing 4 quarters.  In spite of increased income, the dividend has not been raised.  The company claims it would take a significant event to reduce the dividend.

There was no breakdown of sales by product type. (tupperware, cosmetics, etc)  I'd like to see this breakdown as I feel the sales of high end tupperware in North America is doomed with products like gladware.
