$100 to $500 MC

Interesting products but big market cap for a company that has done
nothing but lose money.  Business week article notes that Macrovision
has hidden asset of another company.

Don't buy but keep watching it.

Continuing to lose money.  Even had a negative gross profit last quarter.  Down from 5.75 in Mar to 3.25

$10M private placement in Dec05; one of many.  I have no confidence that these guys can make money.  So far they have survived with sexy tech.

rev of <$1M per quarter last year.  Losing $10M a quarter.  Burned through $350M in the life of the company.
