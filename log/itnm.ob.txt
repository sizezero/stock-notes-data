MC $11M and making a little money the last quarter.  Exec salaries
seem low.

The fact that the home page has the latest earnings release, ticker,
and investment conference news seems like a bad sign.  It seems that
the major subsidiary is Continental Trade Exchange

Several big names on their client list: Dairy Queen, Arby's, UPS
store, Ramada Inn.  Lots of smaller customers.

Googling for "Barter Association National Currency" brings up tons of
regional companies that do similar things.  I found a much better
description of bartering on a competitors web site:

It sounds like bartering allows you to change the cost structure of
the transaction?  Not sure.

Big question with the whole premise.  Why barter when you can use
cash?
