rev: 54,457  	53,191  	61,096  	63,088  
inc: (32,117)	1,379  	(4,170)	28  

Much of the loss was due to one time impairment charges involved with the goodwill of acquisitions.

8K released today that announced quarter ending dec will have greater sales and earnings.  Stock spiked on this news for some reason.

This company is in a tough market and hasn't proved it can make money.  Still staying away.

Still hasn't figured out how to make money.  All analysts predice losses in the next couple years.  Not sure why the market values this at $45M
