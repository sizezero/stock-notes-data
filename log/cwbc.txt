Steve mentioned this stock.  He owned some a long time ago but thinks the company might be growing.

11 Branches in Goleta, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Ventura, Roseville (Sacramento), and Tahoe.

Income and revenue growth has been good for several years.  The last four quarters have also been good (sep05 to dec04)
Rev: 9,647  	8,977  	8,153  	8,161 
Inc: 2,151  	1,119  	978  	954

The last quarter is a bit of an anomoly since $914K of the income was due to a tax reversal.  Discounting this the income would only be 1,237 which is an increase over the last quarter but not as spectacular.  I haven't been able to track this down on the income statement / cash flow so I'm assuming it needs to be pulled out of the reported earnings.  Loan growth accounts for the rest of the earning improvements in the past year.

total diluted shares: 5.6M
trailing income: 5,202
trailing eps 0.93
PE @13.8 = 14.8
income minus one time tax break: 4288
eps 0.77
PE @13.8 = 17.9

I find a lot of banks in the 15-19 PE range and the reasonably priced ones are 12-14.  I rely on PE more than PB when evaluating banks since some banks seem to be able to do a lot more with the same amount of money--but I'm still learning.  This bank seems a bit overpriced.

There was practically no forward looking discussions in the 10Q.  If they have a hunch where the company is going, they're not saying.

The company has been squeaking along with low earnings and had one whopper loss in Mar09 of $7M.  If we average the other three quarters we get:

inc: $1,061  	$26  	$675 
shares: 5,915,130 
price: 2.30
==>
Income $2.3M
EPS $0.40
PE 5.8
MC $13.6M

It seems if there's any hope of solvency then this is really cheap.  I glanced at the latest 10Q and it appears they have upped the standards for loan accounting and are confident about their risk exposure. Is it time to look at banks again? Sent steve an email re: this.

The business is still around.

dec 2023
rev 22,010 21,812 21,508 22,825
inc 5,894 6,390 6,282 6,970
shares 8,909,279
price 18.69
div 0.48
==>
Income 25.5M
Revenue 88.2M
Shares 8909279
EPS $2.86
PE 6.5
MC 166.5M
Margin 28.97%
Dividend Yield 2.57%
Payout Ratio 16.75%

The price laddered up 2015-2017 and has been pretty volatile since then. Growth has been modest. Since 2006, EPS, MC, and price have also grown at 5% to 5.5%.

I still don't think it's worth it to look at banks.
