Barrons had a write up on this company. They basically lease containers to shipping companies. Trade war has added some uncertainty to profits. The article caused the stock to jump from 30 to 35. High yield of 6% and a low payout ratio of 35% makes it seem like a long hold. The container industry is cyclical and analysts estimate that this is year 2 of a five year cycle so low PE ratios are justified. Leverage is 3 times equity but cash flows seem consistent.

This really has all my checkboxes. The negatives are:
- shippers could choose to own their own containers
- it's a cyclical company and I'm not familiar with the cycle or even valuing a company that has cycles
- I feel like I missed the boat on the latest bump; pure psychology
- My cash position is miniscule and I've had a difficult time laying off stock purchases and letting my dividends rebalance.

Let's put a buy watch on it at a much lower price.

BUY 25
