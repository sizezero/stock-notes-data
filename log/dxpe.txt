Showing at Westergaard conference.

Provides maintenance, repair and operating products (MRO) to a variety
of industries (oil, gas, mining, construction, chemical, etc).  Still
a small company ($58M MC).  Last quarter may have been bad due to the
hurricanes.  I'd like to hear the story behind this company.
