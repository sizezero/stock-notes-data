Showing at Westergaard conference.

Provides maintenance, repair and operating products (MRO) to a variety
of industries (oil, gas, mining, construction, chemical, etc).  Still
a small company ($58M MC).  Last quarter may have been bad due to the
hurricanes.  I'd like to hear the story behind this company.

At least its multiple has dropped to a more reasonable valuation. Market cap has doubled but the share count has gone from 5.6M to 16.2M. What a terrible return for investors. Stay away from this thing.
