"""
We are a leading global supplier of equipment used in process industries, including papermaking, paper recycling, and oriented strand board (OSB), an engineered wood panel product used primarily in home construction. In addition, we manufacture granules made from papermaking byproducts. We have a large customer base that includes most of the world's major paper and OSB manufacturers. We believe our large installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business.

Our continuing operations are comprised of two (three) reportable operating segments, 

Papermaking Systems: we develop, manufacture, and market a range of equipment and products for the global papermaking, paper recycling, and other process industries.

Wood Processing Systems: we design, manufacture, and market stranders and related equipment used in the production of OSB and sell debarking and wood chipping equipment used in the forest products and the pulp and paper industries.

Fiber-based Products: we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural, home lawn and garden, and professional lawn, turf and ornamental applications, as well as for oil and grease absorption.

EPS growth 20% annually for the past 25 years (1.5 ==> 3.6) but lost money in 2008, 2009

Five year growth has been great but losses before that and lowering of next years estimates show that this is not a reliable industry.  Not great.
