Valuation looks super cheap but it must portend imminent bad earnings.

Seeking Alpha article talks about declining alcohol usage trend and MGP projected a 2025 outlook of a -35% decline in Distilling Solution sales and a -50% decline in gross profit. Lots of other players are reporting the same.

It would probably be a good idea to buy a little bit of this and hope to buy more on a pullback.

The CEO retired and they are looking to replace him.

Only put $20K into this, maybe $50K when treasuries next mature. We will load up if it drops more.

BUY $38
