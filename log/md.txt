I have no experience with neonatal health care.  I have a friend that
used to be a neonatal surgeon.  I'll try to track him down.

Seeing a company steadily increase revenue and income is a great sign
tho.

Still growing but a high valuation.  Market cap is too larger for me to ever look at.  How did I hear of this stock anyway?

Wow. MC is less than a third of what it was 18 years ago. Revenue has been going down the last ten years and so have earnings. I'm not sure what problems their running into but I don't think it's worth it to look into this.

Net debt has been going down since 2018. Net debt has dropped in the last decade but have remained static for the past few years.
