Steve recommended this one.

BioPharma that makes animal healthcare products.  Bovine pregnency tests, etc.

I'm still staying away from the medical sector.

Steve talked with the company at the Denver investor's conference.  They seem to have a few products.

1) A bovine pregnancy test.  This can save for the cow and replaces an error prone manual test unless performed by a vet.  Company claims the product is clearly cost effective.  There are five products relating to bovine and equine pregnancy.

2) A bad appendix test for humans.  Apparently there are a number of false positives with appendix testing.  This can be very bad for older patients because it masks some other problem.  Since this is a human product it has to go through FDA approval so don't expect it to be pulling money in soon.

The company still lost over $2M in the last 4 quarters and has not had a profitable quarter.

It seems that some former employees (Hurst and Newman) left the company to start a competing venture.  This prompted a lawsuit and recently a settlement.

Miniscule sales at the end of the year.  I don't think I could feel comfortable owning this company until sales are up--or perhaps a profitable quarter.
