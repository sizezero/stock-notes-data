Showing at Edgewater Conference.

Handles fiber to the home.  Includes telephony, video and ethernet.
It's an interesting field but the two big risks I see are:

1) Slowly developing market.  I'm not sure how long it will take
   customers to demand fiber to the home.  I know that I am a somewhat
   technical user and I have no interest in it.  It would have to
   replace telephone and TV without sacrificing reliability in order
   to be attractive.

2) Competition.  There must be a ton of competition in this field.
   Ask who their major competitors are and how they plan to compete.

It looks like they're really burning through cash.

10K

Lost $12M in 2005

Fiber only needs to reach close to the individual homes before higher speed dsl can send data the rest of the way.
5000 ft distance to fiber node yields 24Mbps
 500 ft distance to fiber node yields 100Mbps

The rest of the 10K looks more like a prospectus.  I can't believe this immature company went public.

No reason to bet on these guys.
