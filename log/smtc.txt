Opinc growth is pretty good.  Company has been trying to reinvent itself since 2002.  Still dealling with severence packages, etc.

The name changed from SMTC to Semtech Corporation. The ticker is missing from Yahoo but still shows up in seekingalpha and has recent prices and articles. SEC had a securities termination notice in April 2021. It looks like they changed their CIK from 0001108320 to 88941. I don't think I've ever seen this. The ticker changed from SMTX to SMTC.

Still in business and gigantic.

Lot's of dilution. Still didn't make money last year. The stock plateued at 90 in 2021/2022 and dropped significantly since then. I can't believe their market cap is almost a half a billion.

I read a bullish article on seekingalpha. He thinks the recent problems were due to inventory and is about to correct but spends little time talking about the actual company. They have three segments now services for Signal Integrity Group, Protection and Sensing, and IoT systems. The big revenue drop was for IoT which I think is a buzzy category that is past its prime. I don't like that they are upselling to other companies that can replace them with homegrown or other solutions.

I don't see a reason to keep an eye on this one.
