The company makes small electronic components used primarily in
military products.  Components include: stacked memory, image
processing boards and modules, mini cameras.  I don't see anything
amazing about any of these products.  I don't see any information on
any kind of commercial tie in to any of these products.

The company hasn't made money in a long time.  The stock was at 400
around 2000 before dropping like a rock.  I wonder what the story was
that pumped it so well.

Most of the news on their home page is stock related.  I always look
at this as a bad sign since the company seems to be more interested in
their stock value than their products.

Steve asked me to look at this company.  I don't see anything new except for their acquisition of Optiplex: optical lighting systems for military applications.

Hodge podge of technologies that they can't seem to turn into a reliable revenue stream. The price has bounced around a dime for a couple years.  Shareholder equity has been in constant decline.  I don't see how these guys can stay in business.
