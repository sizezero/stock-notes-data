Another super cheap stock that popped up in Barrons. Amaerican axel makes axels for trucks and cars. Good points:

- crazy low valuation
- axels will be the same in non ICE cars so less disruption
- lots of cash flow in the coming years
- increased steel prices can be passed onto customers

Bad points:

- long term debt of $4.0B

Buy a $10K. If purchased then ladder down significantly.
