Steve referred this to me.

Spun off from Barnes and Noble in Nov 2004.  0.19 eps in first quarter
vs 0.11 a year ago.  Forcasting 0.14 to 0.15 in second quarter.  The
bump this last quarter is due to the release of the Playstation
Portable.  This should be considerred a one time bump in revenue.
Guessing (0.19+0.145)*2 for future years earnings == 0.57 (optimistic)
which gives the current price of 28.6 a PE of 42.  Seems pretty highly
valued on nothing more than a retail chain.

Future good news is that 3 new game consoles will be release by MS,
Sony, and Nintendo over the next two years.  This will not only cause
new game sales but also churn the sale of used games.  

May 26, 2005

I just listened to the first quarter conference call.

=== begin notes ===

0.19 earned in first quarter.  Exceeded expectations by 0.02

good selling console titles: Gran Tur 4, God of war, Doom3, Spliter
Cell chaos theory

95 new stores 13 closed in quarter total 1908

0.14 to 0.15 expected for next quarter

full year 1.30 and 1.40 per share

merging with electronic boutique, management is optimistic about
merger

new platforms entering the used market drives sales for gamestop

all three consoles announce backward compatibility

xbox 360 in fall, others in 2006

future console titles: gta san and, zelda twilight princess, peter
jackson's king kong, call of duty 2, madden

future PC titles: city of villians online, fear

momentum in accessories category

s4 docs sent to scc (merger) then need shareholder approval.  Still
early in the merger process.  _May_ close merger by third quarter.

Question and Answer:

8 platforms vs 5 in the past.  How will the store be rearranged.  Weak
answer.

Want details on PSP future sales.  PSP has movie category.

Worldwide xbox launch will only have 8M initial units.  Thinks year
will have more.

Prices holding up well on platforms.  $50 games still common.  "A"
games on new platforms are a $59 item.

Xbox1 continues to be in short supply.

interested in efficiency of mature stores which are a large part of
the business

300 to 350 new stores in the next year.

Lots of integration work with merger

=== end notes ===

Major points:

Good:

* I really like the model for the company.  Used games is a unique
  market that is untouched my wallmart, best buy etc.

* The long term prospects for this company are very good.  xbox360 at
  the end of this year and two new systems by Nintento and Sony in the
  following year will really drive their business.

Bad:

* some of the profit in the last quarter was due to huge, one time PSP
  sales

* the merger with electronics boutique has just started.  The CEO
  think it might be done in 6 months which is optimistic.  I'm
  generally pessimistic about mergers.

* some of the earnings for the year are tied into a timely xbox 360
  release which will most likely slip to Dec.

* company estimates full year earnings at 1.30 to 1.40 per share.  I
  haven't see this break down but it seems _very_ optimistic.  First
  quarter was 0.19 (with one time PSP sales) second quarter is
  estimated 0.14 to 0.15 This means they have to average 0.50 in each
  of the third and fourth quarters.  The only big item coming is the
  xbox360 which has a good chance of being either late or short of
  units or both.

Summary:

With current price of 28.50, management year end estimates of 1.35
give a PE of 21.  With the merger and possible slippage in xbox360 I
would lean towards lower earnings, maybe even half the estimate giving
the current price a PE of 30 to 40.  I like the company but it seems
overvalued.  If the merger doesn't go smoothly or the xbox360 stalls,
the stock may pull back and afford a buying opportunity.

Questions: Where does the company see these huge earnings coming from
in the 3rd and 4th quarters?

Nov 21, 2005

Merger completed Oct12

Earnings call scheduled for Nov29

Increasing stock price (30-35) on decreasing earnings () of the last two
quarters?  This is whacked.

Oct25 release claims Q3 will be $0.14 with Q4 of $0.98 to $1.06

I'll have to listen to the conference call to see what they are
counting on to provide their big Q4.

Market Watch articled discusses GME's cheap valuation by any metric.  I think I need to purchase some of this on Monday.  Less than EPAX since the other is a better story.  Maybe $5K and $10K with plans to purchase more as I continue to watch the story.  Worry, am I just chasing value?  I still like the used game market I guess.

"""
Typically, following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of new video game hardware increase as a percentage of sales in the first full year following introduction. As video game platforms mature, the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories, which generate higher gross margins, generally increases in the second and third years. The net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the second and third years. Unit sales of maturing video game platforms are typically also driven by manufacturer-funded retail price decreases, further driving sales of related software and accessories.

They certainly have the ability to raise their payout ratio to 30% or 40% which could give a hefty yield of 4%+  I now feel underweight in the stock as the yield makes me willing to sit on it for a while.  There's still no reason to not buy at a discount.  Add a buy order at $23.75

September Barrons article talks about other stores:

"""
A recent acquisition exemplifies the company’s diversification strategy. On Aug. 2, GameStop purchased 507 AT&T (T) authorized retail stores, making GameStop AT&T’s largest retail store operator. This addition brought GameStop’s “technology brand” retail-store base to 1,566 compared to zero just a few years ago. This includes 1,424 AT&T Mobility/Spring Mobile stores, 72 Simply Mac stores, and 70 Cricket stores. We expect further growth of these businesses through store acquisitions and repurposing of some GameStop stores.

Article from Barrons:

"""
The Battle has just begun for GameStop

When we wrote positively about videogame retailer Gamestop's shares in January, we conceded that "it faces a big threat" from increasingly popular digital game downloads and shopping malls' fading charms. The stock, already down by 50% since late 2015 on these worries, had just slumped further on disappointing Christmas sales.

Last week felt lilke dja vu. GamsStop (ticker: GME) gave lower-than-expected 2017 guidance of $3.25 a share and said it would close at least 150 stores this year. Shares fell almost 14%, finishing the week at $20.70. We had suggested buying at $23.58 a share ("GameStop Shares Could Be a Game Winner", Jan 21). We still like the stock.

Though the transition to digital is admitedly accelerating, weakening Wall Street sentiment is hurting too. For instance, Joseph Feldman, an analyst with Telsey Advisory, recently switched from Buy to Hold with a reduced price target of $24.

GameStop's well-regarded management needs time to pull off its planned transition to a more diversified merchandisere of electronic items--say, by increasing sales of AT&T--supported phones, or expanding Simply Mac stores. The shares trade at just 3.1 times earnings before interest and depreciation, and amortization, notes William Nasgovitz, portfolio manager of the Heartland Value fund. "We like this stock in the low 20s because of its free cash flow," he says. GameStop just raised its dividend, giving it a 7.3% yield. New products like Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Scorpio could be catalysts. Given the value, we wouldn't surrender.
