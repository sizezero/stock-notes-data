"Management believes consolidation among financial institutions in its market area has created significant gaps in the ability of large banks to serve certain customers, particularly the Company’s target customer base of small and medium-sized businesses, professionals and other individuals."

"The increase in the Company’s net interest margin for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, as compared to the same periods in 2004, is primarily due to increased loan volume coupled with rising short-term interest rates and the Company’s ability to manage its cost of funds through increased volume of core deposits."

I sure seemed to miss this one.  Maybe the problem is not taking into account the upsides of acquisitions and the temporary cost they place on a company.  On the other hand, maybe the stock inflation is due to this being a higher market cap bank.  This stock is still too rich for me.
