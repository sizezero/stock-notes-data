Showing at Westergaard conference.

Interesting company that performs image processing primarily for the
department of defense (aircraft, satelite, submarine images).  Strange
anomoly: huge, one-time earnings in Dec05.

I'd like to hear their story.

Salaries look crazy.  VP earns over $1M per year.

Declining revenues and amazingly, even negative gross profit last quarter

dec05 to mar05
inc ($1,523) 	($173) 	$2,499   	$5,924 
shares 	3,850,846
price 18.40
==>
EPS $1.75
PE 10.5
MC $70.9M

It seems that customers have stopped using the company's products and the company is resorting to lawsuits for revenue.
