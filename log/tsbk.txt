20 branches south peninsula to tacoma; 7 new in the past year.  Since
1998 public offering repurchased 48% of stock.  Sep 04 acquired 7
Venture bank branches.  No hint of investor relations / stock pumping.
Company founded in 1915 went public in 1997.  Decreasing revenue and

of the depressed Grays harbour area.

P:22.36 PE:14.65 PB:1.17 MC:77 are all great values for a bank.
Slightly declining revenue and income for three years.  Great value
play but needs to be backed by earnings.  According to 10K, Branch
acquisitions of a year ago should be contributing to growth by now.
