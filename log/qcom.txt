Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand: Can't see customers seeking out this brand
  Switching: Not sure how plug compatible different chips are
  Cost: R&D rising; maybe cost is a barrier?
  Protected: patents seem strong
  Other: Licensing makes growth easy
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs? Most of the existing network technologies will still be dominant five years from now.  New ones will appear but it takes time to implement.

Interesting conversation in Feb Barron's

Barrons had a positive article.  Talks about activist investors trying to get value out of the company via buybacks, dividends and possibly breaking the company into licensing (high margins) and manufacturing (low margins).  CEO still thinks there is synergy between these groups.  $29.6B in cash may make the PE look more attractive.

Backing out cash.  Discount of $18 per share. It's worth picking up an initial block at the current price with a plan to buy more at a discounted PE of 8.
