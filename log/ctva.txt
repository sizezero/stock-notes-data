Notes from last quarter's conference call and slides. second quarter, june 1, 2019

Selling seeds, herbicides, etc.

Lots of talk about investor friendly company, divy, buybacks, owner mindset for employees.

Global sales.

Reading this is like reading a farm report. I don't think it's worth it for me to try and understand this company. Since I have 100% cap gains in this stock, just hang onto it for the divy and watch the story going forward. There could be downwards pressure on the stock due to the spinoff.
