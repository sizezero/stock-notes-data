Last quarter's problems claimed to be due to competitive pressure: lower prices, lower margin products.  Operating expenses still held at 17% of sales.

Sales are to a few large OEM customers (e.g. Motorolla)

No forward looking statements in 10Q.

Looks like a tough business and not valued low enough.  Solid balance sheet $15M cash, little debt, but no significant asset play.
