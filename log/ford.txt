assuming a year of last quarter's earnings ==> EPS $0.39 PE 22.4

Last quarter's problems claimed to be due to competitive pressure: lower prices, lower margin products.  Operating expenses still held at 17% of sales.

Sales are to a few large OEM customers (e.g. Motorolla)

No forward looking statements in 10Q.

Looks like a tough business and not valued low enough.  Solid balance sheet $15M cash, little debt, but no significant asset play.

Still in the same business.

Losing money for years. I'm not sure how long the balance sheet will hold up. Price is languishing around 0.67
