Ugh.  This seems like such a speculative play.  Put in a lowball number in case there is a pullback to start an entry level position. 4% yield

Jack Hough had a positive article in Barrons. It started questioning the run up to $55 but then reviewed the upcoming merger and the selling of less productive parts of the business. Some analysis have given this a $66 price target in 2025.

Over the years it's delivered a measly 5.6% annual return but the 3-5% divided has made it a decent place to park money. It's too bad I never bought more of this. My stock was in a retirement account that always had a low cash balance so I never picked up more. I've got $10K in that account so let's add a more reasonable buy price.

BUY $50.00
