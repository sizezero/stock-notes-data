Strange that quarterly report is in an 8-K instead of a 10-Q

year ago quarter earnings 2,201,000K

EPS $0.97

Lots of expectation built into the price.  Estimates are for eps of $1.40 next year which still leaves it at a pretty high PE.  I'm reluctant to sell since I just recently bought the stock.  Is that dumb?

"""
We conduct our business globally and are managed geographically in five segments: the United States and Canada; European Markets; Emerging Markets; Asia Pacific; and Japan.
"""

Hopes "Advanced Technologies" will contribute to future earnings: "application networking services, home networking, hosted small-business systems, optical networking, security, storage area networking, unified communications, video systems and wireless technology"

Good overview of strategy

"""
Over time, we believe that the Internet and the various networks associated with it, including corporate intranets, cable, broadband and dialup networks, and voice and video networks, will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated, intelligent system or, as we refer to it, an Intelligent Information Network. This is our vision for the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems. In this evolving environment, we believe successful vendors will be capable of providing a broad spectrum of products aimed not at a particular technology platform but at solutions to networking problems that span all segments. As such, many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that an Intelligent Information Network would demand, making the Network the Platform for the next generation of value added communications.

Market trends and company strategy:
"""
We refer to the evolutionary process by which adjacencies arise as market transitions. One example of a market in which a significant market transition appears to be underway is the enterprise data center market. We believe the market is at an inflection point, as awareness grows that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness. We further believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market will accelerate in the next 12 months, due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization and the rise in scalable processing. Virtualization is the process of aggregating the current siloed data center resources into unified, shared resource pools that can be dynamically delivered to applications on demand thus providing the ability to move content and applications between devices and the network.

Other market adjacencies on which we are focusing attention include those related to the increased role of video, collaboration, and networked Web 2.0 technologies across our customer markets. The key market transitions relative to the convergence of video, collaboration, and networked Web 2.0 technologies, which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads, appear to be evolving even faster than we had anticipated earlier this year. Cisco TelePresence systems are one example of our product offerings that have incorporated video, collaboration, and networked Web 2.0 technologies, as customers evolve their communications and business models.

We believe that the architectural approach that has served us well in addressing the market adjacencies in the communications and information technology industry will be adaptable to other markets. Examples of market adjacencies where we aim to apply this approach are the consumer, electrical services infrastructure, and video market segments. For the consumer market, through collaboration with technology partners, retailers, service providers, and content publishers, we are striving to create compelling consumer experiences and make the network the platform for a variety of services in the home, as broadband development moves from a device-centric phase to a network-centric model. In the electrical services infrastructure market, we are developing an architecture for managing energy in a highly secure fashion on electrical grids at various steps from energy generation to consumption in homes and buildings. With regard to the video market segment, we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation, distribution, and use of end-to-end video solutions for businesses and consumers.

In order to manage our pursuit of diverse market adjacencies, we believe we need the subject area and functional skill expertise of not just one person but many within our company. Accordingly, we have developed what we feel is an innovative organizational structure of boards and councils, bringing together Cisco managers from across many functional areas within our company to collaboratively define, plan, execute and monitor our progress in these many market adjacencies. While we believe that this collaborative management approach will allow us to take advantage of these often rapidly evolving market transitions and resulting opportunities, this is a new management approach for us and therefore there can be no assurance that this organizational structure will help to produce revenue and market share successes in these market adjacencies.

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand - Hutch buys Cisco for a bulk discount + managers are comfortable with Cisco
  Switching - Routers are easy to replace, full infrastructure is more difficult
  Cost - outsource most products, could still have economies of scale
  Protected - mention of patents and IP but no clear examples, mostly works with open standards
  Other - Is very well placed in the emerging intelligent network
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs?

(continuing analysis)

It would be worth it to look at other router/switch companies to see what that competition is like.  I like the apparent stability of the router/switch segments, if there was one or more parts of the AT segment that was a possible home run then this would be a great one to hang onto.  A dividend would make hanging onto it better.  See what the dividend is like in the Spring.

They have been in a transition so EPS seems to have stalled out someone.  The stock isn't particularly cheap at PE13 and the yield isn't high at 2.7%.  Payout ratio is modest so increasing the dividend is possible.  Sell at yield of 2.5%, buy at yield of 4%

PE looks crazy overvalued but margins, dividend growth, share buybacks all look great. Barrons just called this the number one sustainable company whatever that means. (the criteria was not obvious) The payout ratio is looking a little high. Let's set a sell for a payout ratio of 80. We should re-examine the company at that point.

Dan Niles noted that this can be considered an undervalued AI play. Growth has been slow and steady but the PE is low relative to the rest of the industry.

I'm not confident on this sell price but the PE is going up.
