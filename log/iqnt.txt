Motley Fool Dec 2 2009 "Dream Stocks for Tech Investors" article:
"""
Neutral Tandem provides tandem interconnection services to wireless, wireline, cable, and broadband carriers. It's been busy expanding its reach and carrying more data over its networks, which boosted its third-quarter revenue by 44% year over year, with profit jumping 80%. The strong momentum prompted it to raise its fourth-quarter guidance, and many CAPS members like the growth potential of the small-cap company. It's increasing its presence in existing markets and entered 10 new ones in the quarter. It has minimal debt on its balance sheet and many investors believe it will continue to use its cash wisely to position itself in profitable markets. In CAPS, about 96% of the 333 members rating Neutral Tandem expect it to outperform the market.

Looks promising.  I need to understand the underlying business a little more.

Jan 10, 2010

I need to understand this company in depth.  This looks more like something I purchase once or twice and watch instead of something I want to accumulate over the year.

Search for TDM in wikipedia for a description of the network.  It basically splits a connection into several time chunks such that each chunk is guaranteed a certain bandwidth.  An example is splitting a 10Mbit line into 178 separate 56K terminal connections.

From company web site:
"Services used by 9 of the nations 10 largest wireless carriers."  Allows cable companies to compete with ILECs.  ILEC== incumbent local exchange carrier: owns phones for a geographic area.  Competes with CLEC: competitive local exchange carrier. 

From 10Q:
Before tndm, ILECs provide tandem switching between competitive carriers and charge large per-minute fees.  tndm allows competitive carriers to save a lot of money.  Company description in a nutshell "The Companyâ€™s services enable competitive carriers to exchange traffic between their networks without using an ILEC tandem for both local and long distance calls. ".

Scary quote from 10-Q
"""
We believe that our customers are currently frequently direct connecting their networks, even for lower traffic switch pair combinations, for various reasons, including in order to avoid paying a transit fee. As our customers grow, the amount of traffic exchanged between them grows, thus leading to the risk that they will increase the number of direct connections between their switches and remove traffic from our tandems. The risk of direct connections will increase as more carriers move to an IP-based interface, because direct connecting between two IP-based carriers is less complex, thus enabling more direct connections. 
"""

Motley Fool value folks are in love with the company.  It looks like the existing business is growing more competitive _and_ companies are doing it themselves.  The one bright spot is a new business opportunity of Ethernet eXchange which helps improve IP switching.

Should I just take the loss?  I'm averse to selling at a loss because I have such a large loss carry over right now.  Not a good reason to hold.

Not a great company but crazy growing revenues.  If I keep it it's not a value play but a speculative revenue play.

Company bought 3.3M of its own shares @16.25, 9.5% of shares outstanding.  It's hard not to look at this as good news.
