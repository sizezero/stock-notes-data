Steve likes this because they're going to start selling yogurt which he thinks is the next big thing.  I can't complain about a $60M MC with a 4.2% yield.

Balance sheet looks good.  Company appears to be commmitted to dividends.  Stone Cold Creamery is the ice cream stores, yogurt store has another name.  352 stores in 37 states.  PE seems high but maybe nothing to worry about due to the yield.  Last 3 months paid $600K in dividends and kept $944K in earnings.  Seems like a crazy commitment to dividends.  Crazy good?

9 company owned stores 301 franchises

69% rev sales of confections to franchises and others
11% rev sales at owned stores
20% franchise fees and royalties
percentages stable for at least 3 years

Strategy:
Product Quality and Variety
Store Atmosphere and Ambience: 40% of confections made in store
Site Selection: all aproved by upper management
Customer Service
Increasing same store sales: packaging, product selection
Enhanced Operating efficiencies: MRP II (material requirements planning), POS divest company owned stores to reduce real-estate risk.

50% of products made in store as opposed to 40% two years ago.

Factory sales up to 75% of rev.  Store sales down to 5%.  This trend should continue so margins on factory sales are key.

Entered into agreement with The Grove for exclusive right to open RMCF stores in airports.  3 stores opened so far.

Strategy not noticably different.

"""
Factory sales increased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to an increase of 28.8% in product shipments to specialty markets and growth in the average number of stores in operation to 324 in fiscal 2008 from 310 in fiscal 2007. Same store pounds purchased in fiscal 2008 were down approximately 9% from fiscal 2007, more than offsetting the increase in the average number of franchised stores in operation and mostly offsetting the increase in specialty market sales. The Company believes the decrease in same store pounds purchased is due primarily to a product mix shift from factory products to products made in the stores and softening in the retail sector of the economy.
"""

Factory gross margins down to 32.9% from 34.2%

7 company owned 315 franchise owned.

factory sales dropped 2%.  store sales increased 2%

Co-branding Strategy

On January 26, 2007 the Company began testing co-branded locations with a variety of strategic partners. Co-branding a location is a potential vehicle to possibly exploit retail environments that would not typically support a stand alone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store. Co-branding can also be used to more efficiently manage rent structure, payroll and other operating costs in environments that have not historically supported stand alone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores. The Company’s and/or its co-branded partner’s franchisees currently operate twelve (12) locations.

The Company is still in the testing and evaluation stage of its co-branding strategy and believes that if this strategy proves financially viable it could represent a significant future growth opportunity for the Company.

"""
The most important factors in continued growth in the Company’s earnings are ongoing unit growth, increased same store sales and increased same store pounds purchased from the factory. Historically, unit growth has more than offset decreases in same store sales and same store pounds purchased.
"""

Loss in factory is a result of sales of more in store made product.

Competitive advantage

 Company Moat
  Brand: worth little, target customer is walking tourist so I'm not sure how much the brand matters.  I'll check out a franchise today
  Switching: no comittment.  Anyone can buy chocolate anywhere.  I suppose choosing the right location for the stores provides some protection
  Cost: the franchise model with 5-10 "laboratory" company stores provides some amount of cost protection.  e.g. POS and various inventory systems can provide cost savings to the whole operation.  I don't think this is significant especially compared with larger chocolate makers.
  Protected: Name is trademarked.  No patent protections.
  Other: In store chocolate prep is a significant draw.  Other stores may take time to duplicate this.
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs? Store location and ambiance is good for three years.

Competitors
 For 3 competitors
  Read current annual report
  Competitors are large private companies (Godiva, Russell Stover Candies, Sees)
 What is the biggest risk to the company over the next 5 yrs? Large candy maker duplicates in store chocolate prep.
 Probability of it happening: ???

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. -4.9% 
  5 yr revenue growth. 1.4%
  Current net profit margin (earnings/revenue). 12.7%
  Current ROE (earnings/stockholders_equity). 24.5%
  % long term debt to equity. 0%

I like the way the CEO runs the business.  Clean balance sheet and healthy dividends.  The growth has been slow but any growth at all will be good news and it's clear that they have plenty of geographic markets to get into.  It's a good company that I want to own a little of.  In order to be a great company it needs clear competitive advantage (perhaps brand growth) and stable five year earnings growth.

I visited the Seattle stores.  The location selection was perfect: #1 one block from Pikes market, #2 on the corner of 1st and Yestler smack in the middle of Pioneer Square.  Pike store was always busy, Pioneer Square store less so.  Latest earnings report came out with lot's of global stores opening including one in Dubai.  I have a lowball buy order in but decided to buy some more at market.

The PE is a hair below confectioners average of 15.9  Instead of choosing a buy/sell price based on PE let's choose div/yield.  buy at 6% sell at 2%.  $0.10/share per quarter.  $0.40 per year. Price = Div/Yield

Steve is seeing really good reports from China and thinks the stock could double ini 3 years.

Now that the stock is at 12.35 I feel like I missed the boat.  Maybe wait for a contraction?  Even if I take the last two quarters as normal it still has a PE of 15.6 which has a bit of growth priced in.  Try buy at 5% yield, sell at 2.5%

Just filed 10K. I see it on seeking alpha but not on the SEC page.

Share count down slightly: 5,905,436

"stores operating in 38 states, Canada, South Korea, Panama, and the Philippines" Still owns U-Swirl which are in a crazy variety of names (“CherryBerry,” “Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt” and “Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt.”) probably due to acquisitions. Locations expanding to outlet centers and airports. Definitely high foot traffic but may be a sub-par experience.

Produces chocolates at corporate CO facility for quality--yet franchises don't have to buy this?

No traditional media advertising. Some targeted social media advertising.

Try to combine with othere brands for advertising purposes. e.g. worked with Kellogg to make chocolate breakfast cerial with RMCF logo on the box.

Continued ownership of U-swirl (with a history of losses) is a risk.

Management discussion lists big risks:
1) lack of full retail recovery from 2008 and competition from online sales
2) Lack of bank funding making it difficult to open a franchise
3) reversing the declining sales of franchises from factory

I just read the previous quarter's conference call and the management didn't seem very professional. Maybe this isn't a good company to own.

I never realized how small this company is. I guess it makes sense since Steve was into small caps.

Uggh. Bad management is a bad sign but tiny company, tiny valuation, decent div, and very manageable payout ratio makes it look like a keeper. I should read the transcript to the next conference call.
