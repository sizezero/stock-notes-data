Industry: Industrial Goods / General Contractors
CEO: Anthony J. Guzzi 
Year took office: joined company in 2004, CEO Jan 2011.  Worked at UTX.  First time CEO earning $2.5M

New CEO; miniscule dividiend yield (0.70%) and not-low PE.  I'll just read the last 10-K, not five years worth.

86% of revenue comes from the US.  Competitors are many small fragmented servicers as well as much larger companies.  Major jobs come from competitive bids.  Decline in construction means that many companies are taking lower bids at slim margins.

Article on the lower maintenance of LED light bulbs features a blurb from USM a division of Emcor about how there's less maintenance.  American Facilities Segment is 30% of revenues but bulb replacement is a minor fraction of that.  Still, continued solid state improvements could reduce maintenance across the board.

Lots of big acquisitions in the last year.  USM acquired for $255M.
