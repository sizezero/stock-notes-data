$50 to $500 MC

Makes pumps.  They seem to be good at losing money.  Not sure if there
is a story here.  What's up with the Jan05 stock surge?  Institutional
investing?

Dec 15, 2005

shares outstanding 34M (36M diluted)
MC @ 7.3 = 262M (reported as N/A on yahoo for some reason)

CEO salary $900K

From 10Q:
"We believe that our existing cash, cash from operations, and credit facilities at July 31, 2005 are adequate to fund our operations through April 30, 2006"

This is not a cheap stock by any means.  No earnings and high valuation means I have to stay away.

Sep 27, 2009

No earnings in years.  Recent cash infusion has diluted the stock.  Cutting costs in an attempt to get a positive cash flow.
