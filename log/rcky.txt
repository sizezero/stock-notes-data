jan05 acquired EJ footware
pension plan--need to look at that.
It looks like the drop in share price is due to a cancelled military boot contract.  In spite of that, it is still trading at a low present and future multiple.  Compare to BOOT, TBL, and WWW.

Lower military sales and one time stock option accounting lowered earnings.  Margins are up since military sales have lower margins.  Small one time charges to curtail the "defined benefit pension plan".

"The Company stated it remains comfortable with its previously updated guidance for fiscal 2006. The Company expects revenues to be in the range of $287 million to $292 million, and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.38, including a non-cash charge of approximately $0.07 per share related to stock option expensing. Excluding stock option expensing, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. It is important to note that the Companyâ€™s guidance for fiscal 2006 does not include any footwear sales to the military compared to approximately $27.7 million in fiscal 2005."

It seems 2006 estimates are in line with trailing 12 month estimates.

Earnings guidance for a loss next quarter pummeled the stock by 42%.  Steve says that lost trust in management will take a couple good quarters to restore so there should be no rush to look for a buying opportunity.
