Decreasing revenues for 3 years, last year up to 02 revenues.  Last
quarter included a one time impairment charge; excluding impairment
inc was 1700.  Shares outstanding increasing every quarter.  15
branches along WA/OR border; most in Clark County.  Merging with
American Pacific Bank to get a few branches in Portland and OR.
Impairment charge looks to be a very cautious move.
