Executives overpaid.  Company has declining revenues and is not profitable.

Jan 25, 2025

Starting being slightly profitable up through 2018 then tanked.

The company makes matress and furniture fabrics. Production is in NC and at the Dominican Republic/Haiti border. Restructuring by closing down Canadian production is causing some short term earnings problems.

I'm not sure why I should look into this business. I can't think of how they can compete with lower labor elsewhere.
