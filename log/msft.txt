Dec 5, 2005

I need to sell some of this this month to offset the loss of CAFE.  I
activated the Schwab account and am trying to sell a little.  I have
no idea how to analyze this so I just put a limit order in just a
little above the market price.

Finding the cost basis could be problematic.  The split adjusted
prices between 1990 and 1995 were between 0 and 4.

Due to our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Therefore, these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss that is directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to motivate shared effort. Segments should not be viewed as discrete or easily separable businesses.

R&D $6.58B, 14.9% of rev

Strategy
 1) strengthen core products (windows, office, exchange)
 2) succeed in adjacent businesses (unified communications)
 3) new markets
 4) Delivering software services (online)

"""
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, Home and Entertainment has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future.

================

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand - Brand is a bit tarnished even though office is ubiquitous
  Switching - switching office and sharepoint is very difficult, windows not so bad
  Cost - printing CDs plus R&D, only open source can really compete
  Protected - Patents equal protection and liability
  Other
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs? There will be erosion of windows but I don't see any serious threat to office.  Office is safe for 3 years

Competitors
 For 3 competitors
  Read current annual report: Apple, Google
 What is the biggest risk to the company over the next 5 yrs? Pad Computing, Cloud computing, cell phones.  I don't see this penetrating business but maybe execs could live with a pad.
 Probability of it happening. 40%

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. 75%
  5 yr revenue growth. 43%
  Current net profit margin (earnings/revenue). 38% (ind 23%)
  Current ROE (earnings/stockholders_equity). 43% (ind 26%)
  % long term debt to equity. 

The cash cows are Office and business.  This should stick around for 3-5 years unscathed but Windows revenue should continually erode.  Buy is 30% discount of industry PE 19 = PE 11.  Sell at PE 16--below industry and closer to market average.
