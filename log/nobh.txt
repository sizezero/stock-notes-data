Steve is familiar with the company and claims that the company has had no real growth over the long term.  I don't have income data beyond two years but the stock has steadily grown with one large dip in 1999.

Pays a modest (1.20% yield dividend)

10Q

Company is optimistic about 2006: Florida retirement is still strong and hurricane damage is increasing demand.  100% of 2005 sales were in Florida.  Dividend was raised each of the last 2 years.  Modest buy back of shares.

The management seems responsible but for this kind of company the trailing multiple should be lower.

OMG! I'm finally looking at a company from 18 years ago that's not dead!

The last quarterly statements are from July 2023. Recent filings show that they are under audit and that recent 10Qs are late.

"""
Nobility Homes, Inc. (the “Company”) is filing this Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 with respect to its Form 10-K for the year ended November 4, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”) because its ongoing financial statement audit, whereby most of the remaining in-process audit procedures relate to the capitalization of costs in Company’s finished goods inventory. Until such audit work is complete, the Company is unable to finalize the audit of its financial statements for the year ended November 4, 2023.

The Company expects to report that sales for fiscal year 2023 increased 23% to $63.3 million as compared to $51.5 million recorded in fiscal year 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company expects sales of $14.7 million as compared to $16.2 million in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. The Company’s financial position during fiscal year 2023 remains strong with cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit and short-term investments of $24.6 million and no outstanding debt.

If they were making money they would probably mention it. After all this time they are still a tiny company at 100M. Don't see the point in investing in a company of this size that is not trying to grow.
