Steve is familiar with the company and claims that the company has had no real growth over the long term.  I don't have income data beyond two years but the stock has steadily grown with one large dip in 1999.

Pays a modest (1.20% yield dividend)

10Q

Company is optimistic about 2006: Florida retirement is still strong and hurricane damage is increasing demand.  100% of 2005 sales were in Florida.  Dividend was raised each of the last 2 years.  Modest buy back of shares.

The management seems responsible but for this kind of company the trailing multiple should be lower.
