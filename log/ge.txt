Severely dropping revenue and income for two years.  Is it really worth a PE of 15?

Government is the largest single customer at 2%-4% of rev

rev 2001-2005: 108, 114, 113, 134, 150
Infrastructure and Industrial is about half of rev.
inc 2001-2005: 14, 14, 15, 17, 16
11%-13% margins

Form ex13 breaks up rev and inc for every segment and sub segment.  This would be a lot of work to analyse.  I wish they'd break this company up.

Disconinued insurance in 2005. This was a major hit 2000-2001. It's a bad sign that they get out of a business _after_ the damage is done.  Probably the same with real-estate in 2008.

Half of rev/inc is from Europe.  Americas only 14% rev.

Without financial services, industrial rev would have grown 50% over the last 5 years.

================

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand: doubt the brand is worth something to consumers under 40; other products?
  Switching: Not sure how replacible large industrial products are
  Cost: Conglomerate may provide cost leverage
  Protected: Many of the products are commodities (turbines)
  Other
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs?  Not much of a moat.

Competitors
 For 3 competitors: MMM, UTX HON

 Probability of it happening

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry (no "industry" to compare this to)
  5 yr EPS growth. -64%
  5 yr revenue growth. 15%
  Current net profit margin (earnings/revenue). 7%
  Current ROE (earnings/stockholders_equity). 10.1%
  % long term debt to equity. 2.88

It's hard to get past the conglomeration of all kinds of separate industries plus all of the financial products.  They have been very committed to dividends but that doesn't help if you can't keep making money.  It seems the post Welch management hasn't really been able to do anything with the company.

I can't see owning this as a solid company.  At a PE of 23, other people must know something that I don't to justify this.  Sell.

The 18 month dip made me hang onto it for no good reason.  Now QE3 has bumped it with other stocks.  Sell half immediately and put a sell order a little higher than it is now for the rest..When would I buy this back?  If the PE dropped to something reasonable then the yield would be crazy high.  I suppose put a buy in at PE 11 just so we notice it.
