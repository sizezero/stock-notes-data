Cost-u-less.  Warehouse store for various American territories, many
in South Pacific.  Flat revenues for the past few years but growing
income each year through each quarter of 2004.  More calculation
problems with yahoo.  Price has jumped a lot in the last 6 months.
Still worth watching as the fundementals are good.

< $50M MC

Poor Jun quarter followed by decent Sep quarter.  I'm unsure if the company can continue to grow.

They mentioned two brances in Hawaii.  Costco is located in Hawaii and there is no reason to believe that they won't spread to other areas if it is profitable.  Bad: CEO pulls in almost half a million in salary.  Good: PE is 9.

Acquired by NWC (US) Holdings/Inc.  May be a private company.
