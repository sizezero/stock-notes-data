Jan 2005 conference call

Increase income due to success of niche markets, efficient pricing, focus on value added products.
Aerospace remains largest market (increased 52% from a year ago, 11% from prev quarter) (used in commercial aircraft from boeing and airbus)
CEO a little shaken in the conference call
dodged question of share repurchase at current low multiple--CEO would rather grow the company
several analysts worried about inventory size

looks like a cyclic industry.  company doesn't feel tight and responsible to shareholders.  Dividends would make this a good buy.

People must be writing off the last nine months in order to give it such a high valuation.  Crazy for a company with these kinds of margins.  Company missed estimates for a couple quarters.
