Jan19 purchased Parker Chandler homes (Atlanta, Charlotte, Myrtle Beach)
"The Parker Chandler acquisition is projected to generate approximately $75 million in total revenue for the Company in 2006."

Low price may be due to the weakening of the DC real estate market.  Dec05 Company cut it's fourth quarter guidance and is looking to expand outside of DC.  Still looking at over $1 per share for Q4.  Plans to buy back 1M shares.

Why is this company so cheap?  Expanding into profitable markets should offer excellent growth oportunities.  The management is looking to build affordable homes ($200K to $500K) because they still sell in poor real estate markets.

Steve has a friend who is interesting in the company for the long term.

An article on thestreet.com mentioned that it's trading below book value ($10.29) and the low price is due to management's miscommunication with it's shareholders the last 6 months.
