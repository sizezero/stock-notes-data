Steve thinks this is a good deal.  They are the only public company which is acquiring strip clubs which allows them to get well run, profitable clubs.  I strip club is basically a cash machine (no inventory) so the business is very simple.

19 clubs.  Media division: Adult club trade magazine and trade shows.  Web sites.  

$1.16M paid in unconstitutional tax while appeal is out.  Could be big one time revenue if they win.

Adult clubs are volitile with the local economy.  Are high end clubs better or worse?

This looks bad:

Our operating margin (income from operations divided by total revenues) was 17.8% for the year ended September 30, 2009 compared to 26.3% for the prior year. The decrease was due principally to the poor U.S. economy in 2009 and the poor results from our Las Vegas club, due to the steep dive in the Las Vegas economy.

The increase in payroll and related costs, stated as “Salaries & Wages” above, was primarily due to the addition of the new clubs in 2010 and late 2009.   The decrease in percentage to total revenues is principally due to management’s continued monitoring of payroll costs during these tougher economic times.

  Legislation that would make the business less profitable.
  General economic downturn that would curb spending.
  Management not responsive to shareholders.
 Probability of it happening
  Local governments are going to want to tax anything and unpopular sources of income (strip clubs) would be a more likely candidate.

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. 4yr not a clear pattern.  
  5 yr revenue growth.  4ry $24K-$83K 246%
  Current net profit margin. 17%
  Current ROE. no earnings.  Phantom income of $10M = $10M/$70M = 14%
  % long term debt to equity. 43M/$70M = 61% (not sure how to use this)

Without abnormal impairment income for 2010 would have been around $10M / 10,005,565 shares = $1 EPS.  PE equals stock price e.g. 8.

Restaurant "sector" currently has a PE of 19.  If we take a fair PE of 15 and discount it 25% we get a target PE of 11.  So, if we can trust the Phantom earnings this quarter then it's a strong buy.  If the charge is par for the course for growing strip clubs then the company looks less attractive.  See Steve about a couple points.

Looks like the company is back on track.  Losing clubs have been closed and written off and new clubs are in Texas where the CEO has experience.

Steve likes the owner.  Says he's a real hands on guy who can do any of the jobs in the club (Bartender, etc).  The one negative is that he put too much effort and money into the losing Vegas club.  It would have been better to dump it earlier.  Hopefully this is a learning experience.

A note on the continued debt on acquisitions
"""
We prefer not to raise capital through the issuance of common stock. Instead, we use debt financing, including convertible debt, to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareholders’ equity. We have a history of borrowing funds in private transactions and from sellers in acquisition transactions and continue to have the ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates in that manner. We have historically utilized these cash flows to invest in property and equipment and adult nightclubs. 
"""

A note mentioned that their industry is comfortable with high debt ratios since normal business operations generate so much cash.

=====

=== Conference call ===

Focus continues to be on increasing cash flow.

"With regard to paying down debt, only at a much higher stock price does it make sense on a tax adjusted basis to pay down our most expensive debt prior to maturity"

This note on debt doesn't give me a good feeling.
"""
If you please turn to Slide 14. Here we have updated our debt maturity schedule. As you may recall, we financed a lot of debt and paid off some borrowings in the fourth and first quarters, and continue to pay off some bank debt and convertible debt in the first and second quarters. Looking at our debt maturity schedule, as if February 6 you can see how it has become very manageable from our point of view through 2021. Annual debt amortization is in the $5 million to $8 million range. We have a small $3.3 million non-realty balloon to take care of in 2019. And we have a large non-realty balloon in 2020, but based on the properties involved, we expect, we’ll be able to refinance them.

Future 2017:
- Sale of seven non-producing properties will result in $10M and will likely reduce goodwill with negative income.
- franchise sales of bombshells
- strong sports lineup near key clubs
- new and reformatted units

On acquisitions:
"""
We’re actively looking at acquisitions again. With the stock in the range it's at we didn’t really, we weren’t in the market in January. So we’re letting our cash build-up. As that cash builds up, we’re going to start looking for place, but it was really easy before. We just put it into our stock. But the key is we’re not looking at top-line growth. We’re looking at growth in free cash flow. We want to see our free cash flow grow at 10% to 15% clip annually. And so we’re being very picky on acquisitions. There's plenty of stuff out there I can run out and buy right now. But all that doesn’t necessarily -- at least the standard I want of basically a three to four-year cash on cash pay back.
"""

Talk about paying off debt.  Still better to buy back stock at $18.

Good discussion of how the book Outsiders helped Eric understand capital allocation.

"""
As things change and develop, as we open up the new Bombshells, if we make an acquisition and cash flow starts to increase, we’ll adjust the capital allocation model. And the beauty of it is, it all boils down to simple math and stock. If the cash flow gets ahead of the stock price, then we'll be buying back and stock and vice versa. The stock price gets way ahead of the model, then maybe there's a point where we can use some paper and reduce some debt. Because the paper will be cheaper than the debt. But right now, I really like where we're at. Our debt is very manageable based on the cash flow we have. I mean, we could sit here and do nothing for the next five years and have more cash in the bank and our debt -- to pay up all of debt in full. So I think we have lot of options, and like I said, it's all just simple math. I love it because it makes my job really easy. All I have to do is breakout the calculator, okay this deal makes sense; oh, this deal doesn't make sense.

Some months ago Ricks announced their new buyback threshold is $27. Keep it a little lower for me since I already have so much in this stock.

BUY $25

In mid-December the company announced that it would have a late filing. The same thing happened last year due to switching accounting firms and possibly the Houston flooding. I called investor relations and talked with Gary Fishman. He said that there is no underlying cause this year.

This is bad in that it makes me think this can happen any year and that there is some level of incompetence. Gary says everyone in the company agrees that this must be fixed.

The good news is that with no cause, this will likely get resolved sooner than later. He also hinted that if they file by Monday then they are technically not late. I can't put a lot of trust in this but it's probably a reason to pick up a few more shares at this exremely depressed price.

10K filed on time yesterday. Listening to conference call.

Negative EPS like last year due to non-cash charges. Next year growth drivers, two recent club acquisitions, bombshells, selling and leasing property. Settled state tax. 4Q is seasonally weak but this was the best 4Q ever. FCF growth and projected still look great. Exceeded 2018 FCF target. Debt increased slightly, total debt 142M. Plan to reduce debt.  Still buying back under $27. Still want to buy clubs due to timing. Objective is to grow FCF per share 10-15% annually.

Locked rates in for five years so interest increases don't have much affect.

Darren called. Asked why filing delayed. Eric blamed new system. I thought that was last year. Bought some shares in Nov, didn't in Dec due to filing delay. Will get back in Jan. Like to have 8M cash on hand. Excess will buy back stock.

Waiting until summer before deciding whether to open more bombshells. Would rather buy back stock.

Next conference call on Jan 10 to discuss sales. Hoping to include people that couldn't make this call and thinks the numbers will be good.

Reading the latest conference call.

Aug 9 third quarter 2023 earnings call. (I guess this is the second quarter)

Reduced income from this quarter was mostly due to they year ago quarter being the first post covid quarter as well as a tax refund. Extreme heat in Texas mentioned as a problem.

Margins are reduced but still amazing at 25%. Debt declined modestly this quarter for the first time. Lots of missed revenue due to a large number of vacations out of the country.

Great comment on stock buybacks: "We’re not trying to affect the stock price. We’re trying to get the best price for the stock we could get for our for our long term shareholders. I just don’t need the cash."

May 17, 2024

Stock has been hammered (currently under $50) and investors are grumbling about lack of focus: expanding the strip club acquisition story to Bombshells and casinos. I'm going to listen to the conference call and see how Eric explains it.

"""
And I'm currently basically evaluating that time line with our new refocus on capital allocation, doing a lot of math right now and calculating whether or not we want to even continue to focus on that at all or take our money and energy and focus instead of casino operations back us back on our core business. If so, we would probably divest a property or 2 of the properties, obviously, we'll keep the Rick's location and the Steakhouse up there, but we may end up with actually withdrawing the gaming license at some point instead of paying all this money for the investigation and waiting the time line they want, I just don't know yet. When I know we'll get that information out, that's what decision has been made. But there's just a lot of new information that's coming in in the last week or so, and we're evaluating all of that at this time, and we'll have a better understanding where we're going with that as we move forward.
"""

The above makes me think they're questioning the casino business which would be good in my opinion.

Problems with Dallas clubs that are newly regulated to close at 2:00 which makes them unprofitable. They are fighting it but it will take forever.

Talks of buybacks. Eric would like to get under 9M in shares.

The stock doesn't look cheap at the current earnings. I would have to have confidence that the next year is going to look great in order to buy more now. Free cash flow is much better and the spring sports will probably give it a boost. Maybe pick up a little when the next treasury batch matures.
