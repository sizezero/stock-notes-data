Showing at Edgewater Conference.

They don't looks to be more than an international telephone service
provider.  Their web page shows lots of value added features
(messaging, web access to features, etc) so they could be a good
"friendly" carrier.

They are making acquisitions and increasing their earnings which is
good news even though revenues are down.

Not sure how difficult it is analysing a company that is based in
London.

I'd be interested in their story and how they are different than their
competition.
