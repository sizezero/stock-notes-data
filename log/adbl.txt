This has traditionally been a very difficult market.  Content creators want most of the revenue and they want their IP to be in some crippling, user-unfriendly format.  Users are generally wary about paying for digital content (iTunes is the rare exception) and will easily abandon one source for another.  Some users will also balk at intrusive DRM.

Lets see what the next quarter is like.
