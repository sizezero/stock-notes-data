$100 to $500 MC

Human resource/staffing company.  Income looks good the last few
quarters.  Valuation looks a bit high.

Dec 6, 2005

huge Sep quarter 4.3M

trailing earnings = 4.3M+2.9M+0.93M+2.5M = 10.6M
11M shares outstanding (from 10Q)
trailing eps = 0.96
trailing PE @ 25.9 = 27

assuming last quarter is not a fluke:
future eps = 4.3*4/11 = 1.56
future PE @ 25.9 = 16.6
Is this still too high for a human resource staffing company?

Ok.  We now have two quarters of solid earnings.  Guidance of 0.10 to 0.12 per share for first quarter 2006.  This is income of $1,291K  Which is up over a year ago but down sequentially.  It doesn't significantly change the valuation.

It looks like the company's earnings are seasonal.  From the 2004 10Q:
"""
Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results
         The Company has historically  experienced  significant  fluctuations in
its quarterly operating results and expects such fluctuations to continue in the
future. The Company's operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors
such as  seasonality,  wage  limits on  payroll  taxes,  claims  experience  for
workers' compensation, demand and competition for the Company's services and the
effect of acquisitions.  The Company's  revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to
quarter  primarily  due to the impact of  seasonality  on its staffing  services
business  and on  certain  of its PEO  clients  in the  agriculture  and  forest
products-related  industries. As a result, the Company may have greater revenues
and net income in the third and fourth  quarters  of its  fiscal  year.  Payroll
taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs, but tend to
represent a smaller  percentage  of  revenues  and direct  payroll  later in the
Company's   fiscal  year  as  federal  and  state   statutory  wage  limits  for
unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees.  Workers'
compensation  expense  varies with both the  frequency and severity of workplace
injury claims reported  during a quarter and the estimated  future costs of such
claims.  In addition,  adverse loss  development of prior period claims during a
subsequent  quarter  may also  contribute  to the  volatility  in the  Company's
estimated workers' compensation expense.

Bottom line: yes the company is growing but the trailing valuation is just too high.
