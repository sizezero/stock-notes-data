Embedded sw company specializing in WinCE and .NET Lost money for 3
years.  First profitable quarter ended sep04.  Dec quarter made
miniscule earnings off of reduced revenue.  Company seems to be
betting that Microsoft will make inroads into mobile devices and
phones.

< $50M MC

Increasing revenues but still losing money.

I've found at least 3 contract disputes: landlords, past shareholders,
and customers.

Oct 5, 1:4 reverse split due to Nasdaq price warning.

Just getting into linux embedded devices.

Discontinued hardware business in mid-2004.

Reduced revenue in 2005 due to losing a large client (Cardinal) to an unnamed
competitor.

Licencing model changed from large fee / no royalties, to small fee,
royalties.  This adds an even more incentive to switch to a free
alternative such as linux.

"We expect service revenue to increase in the near term based
primarily on the strength of our current backlog and sales pipeline."

The company is heavily dependent on being an OEM reseller of embedded
windows and the margins of that product.  They have been audited by MS
in the past and had to pay a fine.  This looks like a risky deal.

Numerous risks are outline in the 10Q: all of which I agree with.
This is not a good business.

Hmmmm...data sheet pdfs are unreadable in linux.
