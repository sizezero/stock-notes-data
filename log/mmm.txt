3M’s strategy emphasizes a commitment to grow at a faster pace, using a four-pronged approach, which includes reinvesting in its core businesses, developing adjacent emerging business opportunities, expanding on the Company’s already world-class capabilities outside the United States, and acquiring companies in faster-growing industries.

Closing out pharmaceutical business (requires too much R&D)

Good breakdown of business by industry and %

================

Latest feature article in Barons praises the company.  Lot's of R&D and product innovation.  Sales and business overseas and in emerging markets (including R&D). One negative, CEO is soon to hit mandatory retirement age of 65.  Still seems to not be cheap. i.e. the article talks about it looking cheap with respect to forward earnings.

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand - worth something in consumer segment; not sure about others
  Switching - complex software is hard to switch; others are low level items
  Cost - company does a good job of utilizing worldwide resources for all business aspects
  Protected - lots of R&D and patents.  Strong IP culture.
  Other - none
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs? Cost and IP are a central aspect of the company.

Competitors
 For 3 competitors JNJ, DD
  Read current annual report
 What is the biggest risk to the company over the next 5 yrs? Not much; losing CEO and replaced with short term thinking management.
 Probability of it happening.  Unlikely

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. 42%
  5 yr revenue growth. 26%
  Current net profit margin (earnings/revenue). 15% (ind 7%)
  Current ROE (earnings/stockholders_equity). 26% (ind 12%)
  % long term debt to equity. 27%

Seems to be a great company but this industry should not grow by much.  Current trailing PE is crazy unless the depressed economy is just striving to get back to a new normal.  Industry PE of 12 seems right.  30% discount for buy and 40% premium for sell comes out to: 8.4 and 16.8
