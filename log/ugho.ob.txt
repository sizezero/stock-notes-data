Company is involved in lots of anti-terrorism activities including products (stun light, chemical products) as well as services (rfid and gps security solutions).

I can't really speak for the products (how long will the terrorism fear last?) but the press release announcing that they expect $35M+ in revenues next year is amazing.  You rarely see forward looking announcements like that anymore.  I have to admit, it makes me a bit enthusiastic but also suspicious.

Outstanding lawsuit filed in Jan05 regarding projectile "pepperball".  Claims that former Pepperball employee violated trade secrets.  Several other outstanding legal problems including an investor lawsuit.

I'm not sure why a startup company that is not making money is giving dividends to preferred stock holders.

There have been so many shares and warrents issued in the last 12 months, I'm having trouble determining what the total diluted number of shares are.

I'm a little concerned that the company has quite a few products and services that are very different and only thinly linked by the "terrorism" banner.  I have more confidence in small companies that concentrate on a specific task than ones that try to do many things.  It makes me wonder if the founders said "terrorism is hot right now, let's start a terrorism company".

Steve is going to visit the company tomorrow.

The hot product product seems to be the Stunlight non-lethal weapon.  I'd like to know how many orders were taken for the product and how many are anticipated in the next 6 to 12 months.

The company plans to release the Stunlight to retail first and then have an infomercial in the oct/nov time frame.  They see a possible consumer demand for the product.

NOTIFY date Nov 1, 2006 any consumer sales generated from the infomercial?
