Steve wanted me to look at the home page of this company.  I assume he wants product info.

Yikes!  $100M MC for a company with zero revenues.  $50M in current assets.  Lots of expectation.

From home page:
Developing new patented rotary engine for industrial uses.
Engine may require no transmission.  Huge plus reducing weight and maintenance.
Still in the prototype stage.
Claims to be 40% more efficient than standard internal combustion engines.
New engine market over $132B per year

My first thought is that there really needs to be some independent tests of these prototype engines.  Laymen (including myself) can't judge this technology.  We can only gamble on it.

They acquired the technology of a company that developed this in 1957.  Surely the significant patents have expired?

What is the maintenence cost of one of these engines?  Surely it is considerably more just due to the lack of expertice.  Huge maintenance costs could overshadow any efficiency gains.

Claims that computer control sensors are responsible for some of the efficiency gains.  This is a bit of a red herring since similar sensors should be able to improve the efficiency of conventional engines.

Some good background on engine technology culminating in the axial vector engine:

From this press release, trials are 4 to 6 months out:

"the initial commercial prototype production
will undergo rigorous testing and evaluation programs including field trials
at Beta sites over the next 4 to 6 months to confirm reliability and
performance."

The company is in really bad shape with no cash and huge debt.  Yahoo lists the market cap as N/A.  Amazingly, headlines still talk about the product.
