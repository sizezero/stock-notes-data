$100 to $500 MC

Software solutions for automating the management of corporate
expenses.  Bad sign, showing at Roth conference.  Stock has dropped a
lot over 5 years and still has insane valuation.

Dec 12, 2005

Well, they sure came through and had a monster june quarter.  The stock responded by almost doubling to 13 since March.

trailing income = 1728 + 991 + 509 + 578

This is with a slight increase in revenue, so it looks like they can increase revenue (due to subscriptions) without significantly increasing their cost.  PE is still crazy at 90 and there is nothing in the 10Q that indicates this will be met any time soon.  Still no buy.

2009 small cap search

Still has crazy valuation (PE 72) but has amazingly managed to grow through the downturn.
