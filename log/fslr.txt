I thought it would be worth looking at Solar.

May 12, 2018

Lower rev. Negative income. Yet it's doubled since I added it to my watch list. I don't think I know how to value extreme growth stocks.

On the bright side, they do have positive cash flow and are the dominant player in North America. I could just by a small amount as speculation with the possibility of buying more on a correction. Competitors CSIQ and SPWR have notibly worse financials.

Watch for a drop to the mid sixties and if so start a small position.
BUY $65
