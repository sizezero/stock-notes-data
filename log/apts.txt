I had my federal taxes done yesterday and it turns out that the quarterly payments from this stock are not dividendes but instead "distributions" which are non-taxable but reduce the cost basis of the stock.  This gives me even more incentive to hang onto this stock. I'm not sure how to adjust the cost basis of this thing.

The big run up and collapse this last year means a lot of losers own the stock and may put more downward pressure on this. I really need a way to judge the value of this thing so I can buy more if necessary.
