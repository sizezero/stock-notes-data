Revenues continuing to decline
rev: 20,164  	20,882  	23,386  	22,821
inc: $1,104  	$656  	$760  	$1,287 
shares: 11,061K
price 10.22

Income $3.8M
EPS $0.34
PE 29.7
MC $113.0M

Still overvalued for a business plan that is little more than video rental.  Having the CEO pull in $450K doesn't help either.

Huge stock gains in the last couple years (10 to 27) but still no sign of earnings.  Miniscule current earnings give it a PE of 777.  Revenues have been flat at 20-25M per quarter.  Even margins of 10% would give $10M inc which on the current MC of $288M means a PE of 29.  Makes no sense.
