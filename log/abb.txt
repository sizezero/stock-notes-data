The international exposure isn't bad.  Keep through 2010.

Still no easy transparency.

Industry: Industrial Electrical Equipment

20-F 2004
Flat $20B rev from 2000-2004
Small loss for all years excep 2000.  No dividends in bad years.
Risk of asbestos claims are prominent.
Principal competitors in various businesses: Emerson Electric Co., Honeywell International, Inc., Invensys plc, Schneider Electric S.A., Siemens AG., Bechtel Group, Inc., UOP LLC, Fluor Corporation, Halliburton Company, Technip-Coflexip S.A.

Two divisions: Power Technologies and Automation Technologies (roughly half revenues from each).

Power Tech business areas range 15%-25% in rev: Transformers, Power Systems, Medium-Voltage products, High-Voltage Products, Utility Automation Systems.  "principal customers are electric, gas and water utilities, owners and operators of power transmission systems, utilities that own or operate networks and owners and operators of power generating plants"  Sales are global.

Sectors for automation: process automation (continuous production e.g. oil, gas, electricity, paper), factory automation (robot cells that paint, pack, weld, etc), building automation (control climate, lighting etc)  Division handles all sectors.  3 Business areas: Automation Products, Process Automation, Manufacturing Automation.  Europe is 60% of the automation market.

Non-core areas include: oil/gas, buildings systems, new ventures.

Raw materials for all business is: steel, copper, aluminum, mineral oil and various plastics.  Risk is reduced with hedging.

3% of rev goes into R+D. 7K patentents.  7K pending.

goals of 2005: improve operational performance (earnings before interest and taxes margins 10.7% for automation division) lower corporate costs, align behavior to rules, resolve asbestos.  EBIT margins are the key performance measurement.

Fred Kindle appointed CEO 2005.  Management incentive based on Warrents (stock price)  100K total employees.

20-F 2005

rev $20B->$22B; EBITA $1B->$1.7B; income positive.

Still two divisions.  Power Technologies is now broken into two businesses: Products and Systems.  Automation technology still has three businesses.

Very good discussion of last year's goals.  EBIT improved but I don't think they reached their goals.  I don't think they are clear on this.  Still have compliance and asbestos problems.  Vague goals going into the future.

20-F 2006

rev $22B->$24B; EBITA $1.7B->$2.6B; doubling dividend

New five division structure: Power Products, Power Systems, Automation Products, Process Automation, Robotics.  Competitors get more varied now that there's a robotics division.

They talk about their goals for 2006 (strategy, execution, people) _after_ 2006 is over.  Vague growth discussion for next year.  Still mentioning asbestos.

20-F 2007

rev $23B->$29B; EBITA $2.6B->$4.0B; doubling dividend again

Still 5 divisions. %  Robotics shrinking.  Power Products growing.

Still talking about privatization of energy industry.  Claims US energy policy act will drive replacement of infrastructure.

Using eBusiness to improve efficiency of raw material purchasing.

Still talking about goals in the past tense.  Still vague.

20-F 2008

rev $29B->$35B; EBITA $4.0B->$4.5B; flat dividends

EBIT margins rising for all divisions except Robotics!  2006-2008

same goals; commitment to reduce costs during the economic downturn.

"divisional analysis" is an informative breakdown and each section has clear fiscal outlook.  ABB gains from energy efficiency legislation.

Joe Hogan became CEO with crazy $3M signing bonus plus other perks.

20-F 2009

rev $34B->$31B; EBITA $4.5B->$4.1B; slight dividend increase

another restructuring.  Old divisions: Power Products, Power Systems, Automation Products, Process Automation, Robotics.

"""
 Under the realignment, the business units from the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisionsâ€”Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division. 
"""

Up to 18K patents+pending.

All EBITA margins reduced significantly. Core 14.4%->11.6%

I'd like to keep going through this checklist but I can't seem to get over the crazy compensation of the CEO and his lack of exp with this company.  It might still be useful to read the 10K of competitors Honeywell, etc.
