Showing at Westergaard conference.

Markets ethanol in western states.  Hasn't made money in four years
and has a huge market cap.  Is this just an energy play gone nuts?

Shares doubled, price plummeted, market cap dropped, and the company is still not profitable. 2021 was profitable.

I'm they make both ethanol for fuel as well as medical and industrial alcohol.

Breakdown of revenue:
 2% Health, Home & Beauty
 4% Food & Beverage
 6% Industry & Agriculture
??? Essential Ingredients
??? Renewable Fuels

It looks like most of the revenue comes from renewable fuels. Alcohol is a commodity business but they claim there are some barriers to entry. I'm worried that much of their business profits are determined by regulation of both carbon capture and ethanol fuel subsidies.

Seeking alpha sentiment is negative. Most of them talk about the core problems of a small company trying to transition from ethanol fuel to these other businesses. It doesn't seem like a good bet. I don't think there's any reason to keep watching this one.
