Company owns 50% of "Joint Venture" manufacturing facility in Hong Kong.  Company purchases and resells products from this company.

10Q

Increased sales attributable to volume of smoke and carbon monoxide alarms.   Could this be due to housing construction?
Several outstanding patent suits filed by Leviton.

No conference calls.  No analysts.

Another well priced growing company.

Steve looked at it.  At first he was very impressed with the margins but he didn't like how a large portion of the earnings (from the "Joint Venture") is cut off into other income.  He called the company but received no response in a couple days which is a bad sign.

They're slow to publish the last 10Q

They're still in the same business and haven't gone anywhere in eighteen years. At least now their market cap has collapsed to a more reasonable level. Reading the 10Q makes it looks like nothing in the company has changed. It's not a great or even good company and I don't see what catalyst would change that.
