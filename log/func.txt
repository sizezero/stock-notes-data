Small east coast bank.  Worth looking into.

I'm not sure it's even worth looking at this. Banks are unique beasts and I would really need to commit to understanding their unique financials. As a business they seem so bad since they are so dependent on the whims of government regulation.

It's a $200M MC and has the price has surged in the last couple years but has otherwise been lackluster for a decade.
