"With the exception of our packaged EMI filter ASIPs and low capacitance ESD devices, we have seen a broad-based decline in demand for our products in the last month," said Robert V.

"We believe this is due in part to softer market demand and in part to the competitive inroads by ceramic filters and packaged ASIPs at certain mobile handset customers."
