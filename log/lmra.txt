Showing at Westergaard conference.

Makes polymers for wireless antennas. (mobile phones / military) They
haven't figured out how to make money yet.  Located in Bothell WA.

They are busy collecting IP and their chip is protein based so they
get the "nanotech" buzzword stamp but I'm not sure how to tell if
their product is any good.

I just read their convoluted 10Q that was released today and could not
find earnings anywhere in it.  I assume they were negative but it
would have been nice if they were up front about it.  Large CEO salary
($600K+) seems like a bad sign for a new company that is not earning
money.
