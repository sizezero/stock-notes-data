Rated zero in the latest megacap screen.  I have a bad feeling about them since they have long squandered research.

Rock solid earnings for the past three years.  PE seems a bit high for a company that is not really growing.  Trailing 6% div yield is attractive right now.  It sure doesn't seem like a deal.  The company is slowly turning into a wireless company (land very slowly going away).
