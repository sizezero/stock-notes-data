Business plan was put into question as in 2004 the FCC lessened the requirements of large telecoms to share bandwidth with smaller companies.  Company seems to be handling this transition.

Expanding to Colorado and Washington.

I need to understand how tight these guys can be squeezed by the large telecoms.

Earnings release today made the stock jump 10%  (still almost half of last years high).  10QSB only has whole year information on 2005 with no breakdown of the quarter ending December.

Diluted shares now a million and a half over non-dilutive.  This is new in 2005.

Still really cheap based on trailing earnings but I'm still not sure of the business and a little nervous about it being an OTC stock.
