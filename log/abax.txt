Risk
"""
In the United States, we rely on Abbott as our exclusive distributor in certain medical market to sell our products. Our dependency on Abbott means that any failure to successfully develop products and maintain this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
"""

Competitors:
"""
Our principal competitors in the point-of-care human medical diagnostic market are Alere, Alfa Wassermann S.P.A., Johnson & Johnson, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Additionally, in certain segments of the human medical diagnostic market, we compete with Abbott’s i-STAT division. Many of our competitors in the human medical diagnostic market have significantly larger product lines to offer and greater financial and other resources than we do. In particular, many of these competitors have large sales forces and well-established distribution channels and brand names.

Our principal competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market are Idexx Laboratories, Inc. and Heska Corporation. Idexx has a larger veterinary product and service offering than we do and a large sales infrastructure network and brand name. Consequently, we must develop our distribution channels and significantly expand our direct sales force in order to compete more effectively in these markets.
