Three keys to performance:
Comparable Store Sales
Merchandise Margins
Operating Margin (affected by above)
Cash Flow and Liquidity (working capital)

Previous year 10K has last 5 years of comp store sales and working capital.  Stores have been steadily increasing but comp store sales percent increase is slowing.  Perhaps they are running out of improvments and the only way to grow is to open new stores.

Expect 10K in late March.
