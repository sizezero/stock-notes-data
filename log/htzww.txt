NAME: Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.
CID: 0001657853

Oct 7, 2021

The ticker is actually for Hertz warrants not the actual stock. If I ever buy the stock I'll need a different log file. Maybe I'll make one just so I can bring it up and take notes there.

The details of the warrant are in an 8K filed on 2021-07-07. Here are some details:

Warrants are exercisable until June 30, 2051.

Exercise price is $13.80

"The Exercise Price is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain dilutive events, including stock splits, reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, reclassifications of the New Common Stock, consolidations, mergers..."
This is wide open but it is not worded as a guarantee.

Warrants don't give a right to voting or dividends but the strike price is reduced by dividends.

There are approximately 90M warrants issued.

Exercising the warrant is not a taxable event.

Somehow warrants are exercised by going through broker. I don't see anything in the web page so I might have to send a message to the broker to ask about it.

Due to the long life of the warrants, the Hertz stock should allways be $14 more than the stock. Why is this different? It's possible that the new stock is difficult to short. It's also possible that the stock is not reflective of the intrinsic value of the company and the warrants reflect the true price.

There's a lot of volatility in both the warrants and the stock. Let's stick in a buy order 20% under the last purchase price for the same dollar amount $49350. I'll also put a limit order in.

BUY 9.4

The stock has cratered mostly due to the EV disaster. No one wanted to rent EVs and now the company is unloading them at whatever price they could get. Old CEO out, new CEO in. More funds were raised so they are not in imminent danger of going bankrupt.

I've decided to dollar cost average in to (hopefully) take advantage of the correcction.
