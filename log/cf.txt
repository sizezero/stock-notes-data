Stock is down quite a bit.  Barrons had a positive article:
- earnings will be bad through the end of the year
- div probably won't be cut
- Shipping costs will keep China from being to competitive in America
- fertilizer will rebound

Amonnia for fertilizer comes from natural gas.  CF is one of the larger companies.  POT is an alternative that makes it out of pot ash.

I'd like to own more boring companies like this.

Ugh.  Dropping revenue over the past five years makes this a tough stock to own. I don't have any idea if this is the bottom of the ammonia fertilizer market.  One way to look at this is that the multiple is 5x the average earnings for the past five years.  I think I've convinced myself to buy a small amount ($10K) and hope it drops further so I can load up.

As far as I can tell, all the expections are baked in.  Might as well sell since it's in a tax free account.

I don't think I have any expertice in the fertilizer market. It's not crazy cheap and it's hard to figure out how cheap it needs to be before I buy. Removing it from the watch list.

BUY None
