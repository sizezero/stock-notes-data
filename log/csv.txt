Revenue has steadily increased over the last decade but earnings have been bumpy but cash flow has been a little more solid.
Market cap is under a billion which is good but top executives have $1-2M salaries which is on the high side.
M&A has stalled but some analysis think it will resume in 2025.
PE seems high for a company like this but in this bull market it might be on the cheap side.
Buy a token amount of the stock ($10K) on a pullback. PE 12 ==> Price $27.00. The latest quarter is supposed to have muted earnings so that could provide an opportunity.

BUY $27.00
