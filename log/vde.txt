I've been hearing everyone talking about energy (and any commodities in this environment) and even though I added to Chevron a bit ago I think I need a bit more energy exposure. The AI energy use could be huge. There's also talk about copper need for improving the grid and building robots but I don't feel good about owning copper. The PE is 15, the ETF currently yields 3%, and has a low cost ration of 0.09%.

I should load with $100K-$500K and then just watch it.

Etrade primary has a lot of BSV so I'll sell $200K of it and buy VDE.

TRADE buy 1600@124.5275 balance 1600 commission 0.0
