Memory production is highly competitive and Micron has had a bad track history.  With no dividend, I can't see buying this until it falls to a PE of 8. I've probably missed the boat on the run up but it's not worth the risk.  Sell at PE 13

While these last years numbers are fantastic and will continue through 2018, it makes no sense to believe that the current margins are maintainable. Still trailing PE of 6 is also rediculous and this will continue to drop in the next few quarters. Now that there are significantly fewer players in the market, there's a reasonable chance that cyclicality is gone. With all of the outside positives (IoT, 3dXPoint) and the current valuation a double from here is reasonable. In spite of this do I worry about the percentage this is in my portfolio. I think the key factor in whether to take some profits on this or not is to see what (if any) shareholder friendly steps management takes throughout 2018, dividends, buybacks, less dilution, or even more visibility would all help. Keep watching through 2018. If there are no steps to be more shareholdere friendly then a large chunk.

10Q

Dilution: "As of March 1, 2018, 94 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity plans."

"Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage."

Analyst meeting and slide show.

"the demand trends in our market are secular in nature growing fast"

crazy long talk about the growing needs of memory and all its applications.

Key markets driving growth: data center, mobile, auto, iot

memory industry will have larger ROI. Somehow claims that supply will remain moderate.

Mention of 3DXP in both tech and product development. 10x denser than dram. 1000X endurance of nand. 1000X faster than nand. Products launched in latter 2019.

Transitioning from debt reduction to capital returns via $10B buyback.  Starting FY-19 (sep) targeting 50% of free cash flow.
Cost reductions. They talk about 30% of sales as a target of capex. They also want to remain net cash positive. Not quite sure what that means.

"""
On the dividend, I certainly wouldn’t rule it out. When we were thinking about a cash return, we started with the cash return philosophy, and then started to think about the vehicles and versus survey all new characters, and half of you want dividends, half of you want buy back. So there’s nothing really consistent. So what we did -- we chose buyback, mainly because the stock price was fairly attractive with the multiple being relatively low. And so that seem to make more sense. It’s not -- it's certainly not a commentary on our confidence around our cash flows, I would tell you.

So I do think overtime we will phase that in and provide a balance. It’s kind of a way we evolved in prior company that I’ve been at. And I think given the cash flow profile of this business, we can definitely do both over time. We just -- we went with the buyback because -- mainly because of where the stock was and our ability to modulate it based on how we’re doing on the cash flow side.

The buyback is not resulting in a lot of share repurchases and slightly negative guidance has made the stock crater. I have to pick some up around $30
