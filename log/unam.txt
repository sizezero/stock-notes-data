"""
The property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by periods of soft
market conditions, in which premium rates are stable or falling and insurance is
readily available, and by periods of hard market conditions, where rates rise,
coverage may be more difficult to find and insurers' profits increase. The
Company believes that the "hard market" that existed in California in the past
few years has transitioned to a "soft market." The Company cannot determine how
long the existing market conditions will continue, nor in which direction they
might change.

Not much visibility.  Press releases and 10Q are absent of chatter.

CEO owns about 50% of the company.  Too bad there's no dividends.
