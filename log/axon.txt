Seeking alpha lists the PE at 70. Maybe I'm missing recent quarerly data or they are using a different share count. It seems like a big discrepancy.

It was stuck in the 20s through 2018 and then had a skyward tragectory. It looks like they have expanded beyond TASER stun guns and are now in body cams, software, and cloud.

Revenue is screaming upwards and earnings just came in for the last two years. I don't think I can value this growth play. I'm a little nervous when all a company's revenue comes from government organizations.
