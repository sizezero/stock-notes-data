In the best years made a tiny margin of of revenues.  No revenues are declining.  Ancient CEO pulls in $1M

It's still around, moderate multiple, low MC, and offers a dividend. This may be worth looking at.

Hmmmm...seeking alpha eps is 3.55 and PE is 7.16.

Revenue and income have been bumpy the last five years. Top executives are still pulling in multi-millions from this company. These are bad signs but it's probably still worth it to do a bit of research just for an exercise.

I didn't pull much out of the conference call. There was discussion about reducing the "roofs" from 130 to 110 which makes it seem like this business is in consolidation mode. Not very growthy.

The last SA analyst report in Nov 2023 was predicting growth with a $3 EPS and price of $38 by thee end of 2024. That definitely didn't happen.

Debt has been going up the last five years. When that matures it's got to hurt this low margin business.

This looks like a bad business. To have any advantage, I need to understand their customers which are Aerospace and a whole bunch of other cyclical companies. I don't think this is worth being on the watch list.
