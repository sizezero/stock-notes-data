Revenues tanking in the last year.  Latest quarter was better.  Earnings seem to be pretty sporadic.  Dividend cut tanked the stock.  Burned through a lot of cash in the last six months.

Not sure how cheap this can get.  Margins are crazy high.  They are staying in business and trying to build a business for femail condoms so I should pick some up if it ever hits a PE of 10.  Add sells at 15 and 20

Emma has a huge averesion to this.  She's not even willing to try this once.
