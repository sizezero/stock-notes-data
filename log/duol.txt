Two classes of stock A and B. Near equal amounts of both.

Goal is to become the key online education provider. Languages are just a start.

Key metrics:
Monthly active users (42M) This is what they consider their community.
Daily active users (just under 10M)
paid users

paid users increased 50% for the previous nine months.

Covid helped their metrics.

Monthly and annual subscriptions. Family plan. Advertising.

From seeking alpha:

High gross margins. Right now, Duolingo is losing money because it's focused on product development and growth. But its underlying ~70% pro forma gross margins gives it ample room to scale profitably like many other software and internet peers.

"I learned Spanish with it (and a verb program for verbs and grammar). But when you are beyond basics it gets useless pretty fast."

I'm a little worried about the stickiness of the subscribers. The lack of history makes it difficult to project this too far into the future.

Emma said Ashley said he started learning Japanese in this but had to leave because it was too basic.

Is there any expertise they have in creating an app for languages that can be applied to other education topics?

Maybe look at this again in a year or two?
