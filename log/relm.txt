Steve saw this somewhere.

Makes two-way radios for various government agencies.  Latest orders are from the forest service and the military.

I always get nervous when the primary customer is governement.  I read the latest 10Q and there it was all a retelling of past facts, no discussion of future strategy.  I have no idea what the market for two-way radios is.  I have no insight into this company.
