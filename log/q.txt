Spun of from DD. I added the two previous trades in order to keep the cost basis and LTCG.

It's focusing on semiconductor and electronics materials.

Barron's article
"""
Qnity describes itself as “one of the largest global leaders in materials and solutions for the semiconductor and electronics industries,” with some 10,000 employees worldwide.

The company provides chemicals and materials used to manufacture semiconductors and circuit boards. Semiconductors, of course, are big business, powering everything from smartphones to AI datacenters. Qnity projects the global market for semiconductors will grow to roughly $1.3 trillion in 2030, from $740 billion today.

$4.6 billion sales in 2025
Most semiconductors are made in Asia, which is why the company generates roughly 80% of its revenue in that region.
30% margins

DuPont shareholders got one share of Qnity for every two shares of DuPont held, which should leave the spinout with about 210 million shares outstanding. Including about $3.5 billion in net debt, Qnity is valued at roughly 17 times expected 2025 Ebitda.
"""

Specialty chemical companies trade at 7 to 22 times Ebitda with an average of 15.5. There is a risk of short term sell pressure as investors sell to clean up their portfolios.

The market sounds interesting and I like those margins. Put in a low buy price.

BUY $80
