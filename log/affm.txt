"Good" company from value screen.

Insurance holding company for non-standard auto policies.

A new majority shareholder had disagreements with management back in Nov which caused the CEO and CFO to resign.  Analyst downgrades followed due to perceived short term problems.

IPO Jul04.  Still a fairly young public company.  Lots of fishy stock option stuff makes it difficult to see how much money will be taken from the company.

Dec 1, 2012

Company is in free fall with years of negative earnings, deteriorating balance sheet and a market cap of $2M.  Maybe six months of life left?
