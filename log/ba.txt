Rated zero in the latest megacap screen.  Too few customers to be seen as a reliable large company.

sep quarter had crazy $3.5B R&D charge that is usually $0.9B  This was due to the realization that 3 787 test aircraft could not be sold.

At current price/shares need quarterly income of $605M for a 15 PE.  Averaged $1B in 2007.

Still seems like a bad bet.  The stock is almost valued at the company's peak in 2007.

Barrons had a flatering article talking about their two latest planes.  These products combined with pent-up demand, could give them solid sales for a decade.  It's worth looking at.

CEO W. James McNerney Jr.  At Boeing since 2005.  Previously at GE, Proctor and Gambel and 3M
Year took office 2005

I don't like the fact that the CEO has jumped around a bunch of big companies.  Only going to read the latest annual report.

Very poor 10K.  Not a lot of discussion of strategy and metrics.

================

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand good
  Switching difficult
  Cost NA
  Protected duopoly with Airbus
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs? This is a strong moat that may last as long as the world needs airplanes

The company doesn't seem to be particularly transparent and is certainly not cheap.  I can't see owning this.
