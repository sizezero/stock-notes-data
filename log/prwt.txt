Slow steady growth.  Now offering a modest dividend.  Stock's up 40% since march but PE still 20.

Diluted eps last quarter was 0.23  Assuming that continues for a year we still have a PE of 15.5 which is not bad but not great.  How much growth is left in this bank?  They've shown their ability to handle the 2000 merger which is a good thing.

They seem to do an annual split of 105:100 which is a little wonky.

This would be a good buy on short term bad news.  Add to watch.

Still getting hammered by the mortgage crisis.  Medford is in bad shape so stay away from this one for a while.
