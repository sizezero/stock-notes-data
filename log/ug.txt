From Motley Fool article: Insiders own 43% of the company but management has low salaries and is paying money via dividends.  Good sign.  92% of the company's sales come from two products (Lubrajel and Renacidin).

No forward looking statements in the 10Q

I like the management but the stock isn't nearly cheap enough for a value play.  There is no real growth story either.

Somehow this company is not making more money that it was 18 years ago. The stock is lower due to a reduced multiple but 15 is way to expensive for a company doing so poorly.

It's now paying an unsustainable dividend as well. There's a lot of chatter on seekingalpha about dividend cuts. It looks like a lot of those folks are owning it jsut for the dividend.
