From Motley Fool article: Insiders own 43% of the company but management has low salaries and is paying money via dividends.  Good sign.  92% of the company's sales come from two products (Lubrajel and Renacidin).

No forward looking statements in the 10Q

I like the management but the stock isn't nearly cheap enough for a value play.  There is no real growth story either.
