Baron's article made it seem like a moderately good deal.  Trading at 16x next years earnings.  At 63 and could hit 80 by 2012.

Bad news is that soft drinks have contracted 2-3% in the last couple years.  This could just be the recession but I think it's likely that health concerns combined with alternative beverages may steer people away from soft drinks.  All in all the upside isn't enough for this risk.
