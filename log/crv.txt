Rejected takeover offer by Bell industries. (Feb05)

10Q

Sep quarter increased op inc are mainly due to reduced sales and admin expenses.
Net sales increased while the RV industry declined.
Relocation of a warehouse will negatively affect gross rev for dec05 quarter.
Good use of cash: reduced borrowing, bought back $1.2M shares, dividends.
Seasonality: highest sales apr through sep
High oil prices (potencially) doubly hurts the company: RV usage and parts shipping costs.  This did not affect the bottom line in 2005.
Severe winter weather conditions can hinder the use of RVs and boats.

Comparing the PE of 8.9 with the industry (auto parts) of 22 makes it look really cheap.

Steve commented negatively:
trading volume low
management only owns 14% of the stock
doesn't like the business (distributers are worse than manufacturers and retailers)
