Still seems a bit overvalued.  I don't like seeing the CEO pull so much money out of a small, unproven company.

The business is growing on ATMs in stores but is also running a declining photocopier in stores business.  Theft from ATMs is $1.1M of the last bad quarter.

Analist comment questions management: "While there were several unusual expense items negatively affecting results, the magnitude and timing of these factors suggests that business conditions have worsened recently and that management's visibility is quite limited,"

They are still aquiring other ATMs (purchase from efunds) and their revenues are continuing to grow.  Huge growth in machines: 10K to 22K from 2004 to 2005. Watch this stock.  

Apr 19, 2006

Fourth quarter hammered with lower revenue that resulted in a loss of $13.6M.  Auditors are questioning the company's viability.  Board members are resigning.  Price only dropped to $6.80 which isn't as much as it should have dropped.  Keep watching for better news.
