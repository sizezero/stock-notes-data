I've left this on autopilot since the split.  There's a number of documents now so let's see what we got.

=== Oct 31 2016 10K ===

Spin-off happened Nov 1, 2015.

By April 1, 2017 Enterprise Services Business ("Everett") will merge with Computer Sciences Corporation ("CSC"). Shareholders of HPE will own 50.1% of the company.  CEO of CSC will run the new company.  Cash dividend of $4.5B will be returned to HPE. New co will have $2.5B of HPE debt.

By August 31, 2017 Software segment ("Seattle") will merge with Micro Focus to create a pure play enterprise company.  Shareholders of HPE will own 50.1% of the company. Cash dividend of $2.5B.  Still needs to be approved by Micro Focus shareholders.

Five segments (% earnings):
Enterprise Group: IT infrasrtucture / cloud (12.7%)
Software (23.4%)
Enterprise Services (7.7%)
Financial Services (10.5%)
Corporate Investment: HP Labs, cloud incubation projects (NM)

8.3% of cross segment earnings.

Many groups under each segment.  Lots of competitors.

Strategies:
Transform to hybrid infrastructure: both cloud and on premises
Protect the digital enterprise: risk management, security
Empower the data-driven organization: open source solutions that let customers own their data
Enable workplace productivity: variety of customer interfaces, mobile, cloud.

Goodwill reviewed annually.

Skimmed segment info.  This beast looks way too complicated for me even though I'm in tech. I don't fully understand the IT buying patterns of large companies.

Third quarter income looks totally out of whack.  Not sure if it makes sense to trust the last 12 months earnings.  Replace it with 4th quarter rev/inc and see what we get.

This is a pretty complicated holding so I probably shouldn't buy more. I could research the spinoffs a bit more. The spinoffoffs look like temporary earnings that won't last.  Put in a sell order for a PE of 14: $26.60.

Feb 6, 2017

Amazing stupidity.  I entered a buy order instead of a sell order.  Let's ride this out for a year.
