"Good" company from value screen.

Creates composite components for the Aerospace industry.  Primarily serves the defense and aircraft industry.

Strange: sep05 earnings are in nov05 10Q but they are still not in yahoo.

Falling rev/inc for two years.  Last two quarters were very good.

==>
Income $4.6M
EPS $1.39
PE 6.4
MC $29.4M

last quarter ==> EPS $0.88 PE 10.2

Last quarter had (451) loss from continuing ops.   Discontinued ops moved them into profitiability.

The company has paid huge dividends ($2 per share, 22%) the last couple years including a special one time dividend of $11.75 per share in 2004.  With their present structure I don't see how they can maintain earnings that will allow them continue these dividends but this conservative mind set could be profitable for shareholders.

No analysts.  No conference calls.

This company is very cheap.  This is worth looking into a little further.
