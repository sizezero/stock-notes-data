Steve recommended this small bank to me.  It's based in Merced (near
Fresno).  20 Branches.

Latest earnings dec3
Past 4Qs
3.9M+4.0M+0.8M+5.0M = 13.7M
last quarter earnings 5.0M with 0.50 per share ==> 10M shares
trailing eps = 13.7 / 10 = 1.37
trailing pe @34.8 = 25.4

The good news is that the company is opening several new branches.  In
the past 12 months loans, assets and deposits have each grown ~18%.

Earnings wise, the company is growing modestly (excluding a big hiccup
in revenues of dec04) but I'm not sure why all the numbers are so
inflated.  PE is 25, (most small banks are 10 to 14) PB is 3.1 (should
be 1 to 2) and I don't see past growth that justifies these numbers.
I guess the market sees huge growth (doubling?) for this company in
the next year.

The stock has surged rapidly in the past year and a half.  The
executives seem fairly well compensated and there is a recent press
release which announced accelerated stock option vesting.  The press
release claims that this is to lower future compensation expenses but
it may also be to take advantage of an inflated stock price.
