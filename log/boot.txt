$50 to $500 MC

Locrosse/Danner heavy duty footware products.  Spike in Nov after
announcement of good earnings.  Last year had good earnings.  Q4 good
earnings.

Not sure why the stock has taken a beating.  The last quarter was
pretty good.

trailing earnings = 2.463+0.408+0.318+2.223 = 5.4M
total shares (diluted) = 6.1M
trailing eps = 0.88
tailing PE @ 10.36 = 11.7

Yikes!  CEO and CFO get paid $685K and $393K respectively.  That seems
way too high.

Cyclical note in 10Q: Due to our cold and wet weather offerings, sales
are typically greater in the second half of the year than the first
half of the year. We continue to augment our product offerings with an
assortment of year-round work products. Weather, especially in the
fall and winter, has been, and will continue to be a contributing
factor in our results.

Optimism in 10Q: Based on our customer's response to our new lines, we
have increased our inventories to prepare for sales growth.
