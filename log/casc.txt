Very little info in the last 10Q about why sales improved so much.
The only explanation is mentioned several times: "Historically, we
have found that changes in the level of our net sales do not
correspond directly to the percentage changes in lift truck industry
shipments, but industry statistics do provide an indication of the
direction of business activity.  North American lift truck industry
shipments for the first six months of fiscal 2006 as compared to the
first six months of fiscal 2005 increased 19%."

The company is worldwide with sales in Europe and Asia including
China.

The company is doing well but from the 10Q, I can't figure out _why_
they are doing well.  This makes it hard to buy the company.
