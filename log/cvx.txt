=== 2006 10K ===

Strategic direction has vague statements about profitability and competitiveness.

Very detailed 10K.  Lots of good charts that show breakdowns by region, etc.

Upstream:
Worldwide production.  Detailed maps of each production and exploration area.

Downstream:
Refinery capacity listed: most in US a few in other Western countries (CA, UK SA)
Sales include Chevron, Texaco, and Caltex.  This includes a large amount of pipeline and tankers.

Mines (coal, molybdenum). Power generation. Energy solutions.

2004-2006
Revenue $150B $194B $205B
EPS Diluted $6.28 $6.54 $7.80
Return on Equity 32.7% 26.1% 26.0%

Company has little control over upstream costs.  Downstream is the only place for adjustment.

=== 2008 10K ===

Same format.

2007-2008
Revenue $214B $265B
EPS $8.77 $11.67

================

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand: Not sure if this is worth anything. Texaco brand is negative
  Switching: Commodity, easy to switch
  Cost: Production everywhere, but difficult to control cost
  Protected: Wide geographic upstream makes it easier to adjust to global issues
  Other
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs?  Not much of a moat

Competitors
 For 3 competitors
  Read current annual report
 What is the biggest risk to the company over the next 5 yrs?  Lack of demand for petroleum or huge discovery.  Massive alternative energy source would be bad as well.
 Probability of it happening: 15% huge discovery, 20% lack of demand, 5% huge alternative energy. Assum all previous are independent: 35% of at least one of these bad events happening.

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. $7.80-$9.48
  5 yr revenue growth. $205B-$198B -3.4%
  Current net profit margin (earnings/revenue). 9.6% ind 6.1%
  Current ROE (earnings/stockholders_equity). 19.3% ind 12.5%
  % long term debt to equity. 

It seems clear that Chevron is a good petroleum play but there is nothing that makes it a great company.  Expect large swings in price depending on the price of oil.  Buy when oil is low and the yield of Chevron is high.  We should never expect a high multiple for this stock.

Stock is still priced for improvements. I don't think oil companies should have double digit valuations. Maybe cost cutting has occurred and will continue to increase earnings? Next years eps estimates are double which would bring it back to single digit valuations.

This is a hard problem. Part of me wants to buy into the "never sell" behavior and not trade in and out of companies but companies don't last forever.  Let's say the EPS doubles in a year and the stock maintains a significantly above single digit PE of 15. That should be a clue to sell some of this.  EPS 12.64 + PE 12 ==> Price 152

SELL 152
