$100 to $500 MC

Owns television/radio stations. Decreasing revenues, not profitable.

MC 391M for a company that is still losing money.  Is it worth looking for a value play in something like this?  I'd be worried that they would just continue losing money.  Still acquiring other companies.  Growing stockholder equity is a good sign.  Net tangible assets is only $160M so no asset play.

Reading 10Q I realize that success of this stock requires success of TV (KOMO) and various radio plays.  Ratings are fickle and I have to admit, TV may be in trouble with all the other entertainment options out there.

Earnings bleak over the last year.  Strange one time charge as well as a one time income confuses things a bit.  MC down to $170M.  Not sure how to predict earnings for this company.  Confusion over the future of TV still rings true.
