I thought Hurd's departure may be a buying opportunuty but the stock just seems fairly priced, not a deal.  Div yield is still crap at 0.70%

Although Hurd put some good processes in place.  Picked up a little.

"""

2002 to 2006 rev steady up from $57B to $92B.  Earnings steady up from 0 to $6B

Planning to reduce real-estate by having fewer, larger consolidated data centers.

TSG, ISG, IPG are the largest revenue generators.  TSG, IPG are the bulk of the earnings.  TSG growing rev and income the fastest.

--- 2007 ---

Business model/organization unchanged.

rev $104B, earnings $7B, R&D flat

Still consolidating real-estate.  Training large sales force.  Vague talk of efficiency improvements and share buy-back to offset stock options.  Lots of acquisitions.  Largest were Mercury Interactive and Opsware Inc. ???

Most revenue growth in PSG.

PSG and TSG still dominate rev at ~$37B each.  IPG $28M
earnings TSG $4.1B PSG $1.9B IPG $4.3B

TSG and PSG have better rev growth but IPG has better margins.

--- 2008 ---

Acquisition added another business unit EDS electronic data systems corporation within HPS.  Provides financial reporting for companies.

R&D flat. 32K patents

Completed real-estate consolidation.

rev $118B, e $8.3B

PSG growth (notebooks) has been offset by declining prices for a couple years

TSG revenue would have fallen if not for the EDS acquisition.

TSG r $44.8B e $5.5B
PSG r $42.3B e $2.4B
IPG r $29.4B e $4.6B

I wish IPG could be spun off as it's own company.  I guess there would be no growth then.

--- 2009 ---

R&D slashed to $2.8B, $33K patents

4 initiatives for 2009: competitive positioning, (trends requiring new products e.g. web printers) operational efficiency, investing for growth, leveraging portfolio and scale.

rev $114B, e $7.7B

Acquisitions: Lefthand Networks, Inc (virtualization), pending 3com

TSG ==> HP Enterprise Business. Contains Services, Storage+Servers, Software

HPEB r $53.6B e $7.2B
PSG  r $35.5B e $1.7B
IPG  r $24.0B e $4.3B

Wow!  Printing group dropped $5B in rev and earnings were mostly flat.  How?

"""
The improvement in gross margin in fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from an increase in the supplies mix and supplies pricing, the effect of which was partially offset by hardware margin declines due to unfavorable currency impacts and declines in average revenue per unit. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to effective cost controls.
"""

--- 2010 ---

R&D $3.0B  37K patents

rev $126B e $8.8B

Same declared strategy.

HPEB r $57B e $5.6B margins 9.8%
PSG  r $41B e $2.0B margins 4.9%
IPG  r $26B e $4.4B margins 17%

Not sure.  Looks like acquisitions are having a "diworsifying" effect.  11 acquisitions, largest are: 3com, palm, 3par (utility storage), arcsight (security compliance management company)

------------

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand - HP brand very strong in printers
  Switching - if the printer runs you'll still by toner
  Cost - largest printer maker _may_ have better efficiencies
  Protected - patent growth huge but probably won't use them
  Other
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs?  It's difficult to tell what if there will be a new strategy but my guess is that profits from businesses will be spent on acquisition.  The future will show if these are any good.

Competitors
 For 3 competitors (IBM, Wyse, NEC)
  Read current annual report
 What is the biggest risk to the company over the next 5 yrs? HP is in some fundemental markets: PCs, printers, software+consulting.  I suppose the worse thing that could happen is that it makes lots of unecessary acquisitions.
 Probability of it happening.  Some of the acquisitions _will_ suck but maybe the hope is to buy something that gives you leverege into a new trend.

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. $2.18-$3.69  69% (IBM has 100%)
  5 yr revenue growth. $91B-$126B 39% (IBM flat)
  Current net profit margin. 7% (IBM 14%)
  Current ROE.  $8.8B / $40.8B = 21.6% (IBM 70%, industry 28.5%)
  % long term debt to equity. $15.3B/$40.8B = 37.5%

Dec 28, 2010

Summary of the previous analysis.  It looks like the printer business is still fantastic but has been flat for 5 years.  Profits from that are funding operations in other units.  Acquisitions are a mixed bag and may be doing strange things with the earnings.  Palm will probably be a waste but 3par will probably turn out well.  40% 5yr revenue growth even on low margins translates into solid growth.  Discounting poor acquisitions let's say 20% revenue growth;  with 10% net margins that's still solid growth.  Diluted year end eps is $3.69 so at the current price of 42.39 we get a PE of 11.5.  Industry PE is 16.  25% discounted PE is 12.  I suppose it's a buy up to PE 12 Price 44.3.    I wish it had a better PE tho.

buy  PE 12 EPS $3.69 price $44.30
sell PE 15 EPS $3.69 price $55.35
BUY $44.30
SELL $55.35

Revenues have declined.
2012-2010:
$120B $127B $126B

Last year there were $20B worth of non-recurring write offs.  Although it's dangerous to assume these things are really non-recurring it's worth looking at.

Here is the two quarters which don't contain the non-recurring hits. Share count from March 10Q

The company has been split for over a year and the first 3d printers are out.  I like the fact that they are going for market share on 3d printers.  Open stadard an no restrictive "ink".

Increasing revenue and income over the past three years. Modest growth, low valuation, decent yield, low payout ratio, good valuation. Difficultly with toner/ink could cause problems in the future. Upside could come from 3D printing.

I'd like to get more of this but I've committed to raising my cash position. Leave this as a buy and put a cap of this based on my portfolio size. I currently have 1.1% of this. Don't go above 4%. Make next purchase $20K if there is a market pullback.
