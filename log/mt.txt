Can't find SEC filings past 2007.  Yahoo only has earnings through 2008.  Sell when purchases become long term gains.

It seems I had the wrong CIK.  Fixed and now it looks like a normal foreign company.  Might as well do deep research.

Industry Basic Materials / Steel & Iron
CEO Mr. Lakshmi N. Mittal
Year took office: founded the company in the 70s.  He's the third richest person on the planet.  His wikipedia entry is amusing.  Merger with Arcelor occured in 2006,

=== 2006 20-F ===

No 20-F on edgar before 2006

=== 2008 20-F ===

Huge sales growth (acquisitions) but narrow margins produce up and down EPS.  Explosion in shars outstanding from 643M in 2004 to 1.3B in 2008.  Acquisitions are a major aspect of the business strategy.

Makes steel in many forms (plates, rods, etc) as well as DRI (direct reduced iron) which is a by product of steel making.

Company owns mindes, mills, distributions centers, R&D facilities.

Very detailed doc covering every region.  Skimming.

2004-2008
Revenue $20,612 $28,132 $58,870 $105,216 $124,936
Diluted EPS $8.10 $4.79 $5.30 $7.40 $6.78

=== 2010 20-F ===

Noting:

* excess capacity (esp. China/India)

================

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand: don't see value here
  Switching: steel is as much a commodity as anything
  Cost: should be able to reduce costs once acquisition costs are resolved
  Protected: some patents, mine monopolies?
  Other
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs? Not much of a moat.

Competitors
 For 3 competitors (POSCO, Nippon Steel, US Steel)
  Read current annual report
 What is the biggest risk to the company over the next 5 yrs? Difficulty of handling acquisitions.  Overpaying of acquisitions. Reduced demand for Steel.
 Probability of it happening. No point in evaluating this since the company isn't earning money.

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. -106%
  5 yr revenue growth. 177%
  Current net profit margin (earnings/revenue). 0%
  Current ROE (earnings/stockholders_equity). negative.
  % long term debt to equity. $19.3B/$62.4B = 31%

This company may do well when steel rebounds, but there's no reason to wait.  Don't own a company this big that can't make money.

I missed a nice sell opportunity last week.  There was a big drop followed by a recovery.  I suppose I should at least have a high sell order in.
