Barron's had a rosy article on this company. They are a recently public company that is the merger of two smaller landscape companies. Some points.

- Company is just $2.2B of $62B dollar industry (2.7% market share) but is still 10x larger than its biggest competitor.
- Big client roster: Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, MIT, Duke, Exxon, Alphabet, MLB, NFL, Disneyland, National Mall in DC.
- landscape market is generally recession proof
- scale helps with accounting, 401K and makes it able to attract the best employees.
- lots of acquisitions
- $1.6B in debt
- next year's PE is 9
- currently below IPO price of $22

Past year has negative income. Slowly paying down debt.

I don't think it's worth it to buy these guys until we have a couple quarters of earnings, debt repayment, and profitability. Keep it on the watch list at the current-ish price

BUY 16
