Provides commercial and residential roofing services.  Also, provides roofing construction services, e.g. sheet metal for metal roofs.

May get the worst web site of the year award.  The entire thing is an ugly flash program.  Zenex is the holding company for Aduddell Roofing:

Huge two year growth.  Slim margins.
inc $6,917   	($288) 	$119   	$1,951
shares 80,137,921 (diluted)

Income $8.7M
EPS $0.11
PE 6.4
MC $55.3M

I'm not sure how affected these guys are by the housing market.  People will always need new roofs.

Stock options look fishy.  CEO was granted options for 30M shares at $0.04 in 2002.  At the current price that could be $1.2M in earnings liabilities.

10Q

"Although Aduddell Roofing had a significant number of customers for the period
ended September 30, 2005, the USACE accounted for 68% of the revenue. Two
customers accounted for 38% and 10% of the revenue for the period ended December
31, 2004."

4M addition options granted in 2005.

It's clearly a value play but the massive options and vain homepage makes me mistrust the management.
