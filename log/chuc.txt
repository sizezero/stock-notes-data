Showing at Edgewater Conference.

Fitness supplement maker that has declining revenue and earnings and
very little cash in the bank.

I'm not sure where the worth is.  I'll ask some of my fitness friends
if they've ever heard of Vitacube.  No one has.

Steve showed me a promo dvd of the product.  It's another multi-level
marketing product.  Success depends on hype so I'll stay out of it.
