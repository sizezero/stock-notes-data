Boeings 90% decline in airline orders could make next year rough but it really just postpones the orders till 2011/2012

Industry: Conglomerates
CEO: Louis R. Chenevert
Year took office 2008, previously President of Pratt & Whitney (a division)

I don't like the idea of a new CEO.  Just reading the last two 10Ks (separated by a year)

=== 2011 10K ===

Variety of products primarily
 Otis: elevators
 Carrier: heaters
 UTC Fire & Security
 Pratt & Whitney: aircraft engines
 Hanuktib Sundstrand: aerospace
 Sikorsky: helicopters

Global company dependent on many factors and contracts.  Only 20% Military, the rest commercial and industrial.  Europe is a big segment.  No tell tale split in sales/profits per division: Otis, Carrier, Pratt Whitney combine for 60%.

Revenue $58B $54B $52B $59B $55B
EPS 5.49 4.74 4.12 4.90 2.27

================

I'm having trouble seeing the competitive advantage in this hodge podge of industries.  I'm sure this could be analysed but it's too much work for me.

Margins 7.4%
Yield 2.9%
Payout Ratio 45.3%

Trailing eps is 4.73 but low estimates for the year are 5.25 with a high of 2.55.  This give PEs off the current price at 15.7, 14.15, 13.38 which all seem high for a company that's this big with such a huge payout ratio.  Sell at div yield of 2.5% and buy at a div yield of 5%.  This gives prices of 85.60 and 35.67

BUY $42.80
SELL $85.60
