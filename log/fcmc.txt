sep05 10Q

Net income  totaled $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2005,
compared with $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2004.  Net income  decreased
27% in the third quarter of 2005,  compared with the third quarter of 2004.  The
decrease in 2005 third  quarter  net income was driven  largely by a decrease in
net interest income,  which principally was the result of the rise in short-term
interest rates since  mid-2004.

Conference call didn't yield any insights.

Wait for 4th quarter numbers.
