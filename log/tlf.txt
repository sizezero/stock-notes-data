Retail business strategy: "Tandy Leather has long been known for its reputation in the leathercraft industry and its commitment to promoting and developing the craft through education and customer development.  Our commitment to this strategy is evidenced by our re-establishment of the retail store chain throughout the United States and Canada following our acquisition of the assets of Tandy Leather in 2000.  We continue to broaden our customer base by working with various youth organizations and institutions where people are introduced to leathercraft, as well as hosting classes in our stores."

Doesn't look to be a bad company but being squeezed between suppliers and customers could be problematic.  For such a tiny company with no divy there should be a significant discount (PE 8)

It would be worth visiting a retail store.  Closest stores are Portland and Spokane.
