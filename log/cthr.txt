New management is in the jewelry business.  $40M in inventory that can be sold at $80.  Won't be sold soon but could be a lot of cash.  Steve think's it's overpriced at $3 but worth looking at.

Last quarter was marginally profitable, valuation still outrageous.  No one is following the company.  Seems like a bad time to sell luxury items.
