There are a number of bad things about this stock: a complex industry, high PE, unsustainable payout ratio, rising goodwill. I don't think it's worth looking at even if there is a price correction.

Seeking alpha had an interesting article that claims the company is fine except for the valuation.  Stick a low watch price on this.
