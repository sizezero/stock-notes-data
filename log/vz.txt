Barron's had this listed as a good dividend stock. High divi and low payout ratio are the key attractiver points. I guess they're a play in both delivery and content.

Barrons had a recent article. Talks about the company mostly selling a standard phone service and not getting into other businesses.

Crazy Dec ending quarter has a big tax writeoff. Removing that $16M difference.

Seems pretty average company. I would need to buy it at a discount since phone companies feel like commodities to me. It's very easy to switch. PE 9

BUY 32.50
