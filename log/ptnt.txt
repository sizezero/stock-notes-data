The company is slowly bleeding money while it appeals a couple losing patents.  One investor is upset and trying to get the company to turn around.  The company is in a strange state since it is trading for less than cash on hand which means Mr Market thinks the CEO will continue to burn money to no profitable outcome.  It's possible the CEO will just continue to bleed out the company with salaries which may prompt a shareholder lawsuit.

At least sell when market cap equals cash on hand

SELL $4.50
