Buying texas dealerships.
Specializes in used vehicles.
Dominating Western states but slowly moving East. Seems like there are a lot of states to expand to.

Stock was down before the announcement of last quarter's earnings.  Now up to 31 from 25.

Looking to buy this one.  It seems reasonably priced right now.

Latest quarter earnings from continuing ops declined to 10.1M from 10.5M a year ago.  They still beat analysts by $0.03 due to the closing of two unprofitable dealerships.  Forecast for 2006 is $2.46 to $2.58.  Analysts say $2.55

$0.12 dividend (negligable 0.4% @ 29.74) payable in March.

Trailing eps is $2.46 which which makes the PE just under 12.  Probably using non-diluted shares.

Just noticed million dollar salaries for all execs. :(

conference call

execs

3 straight year of operating margin improvments
unpredictable swings in vehicle sales
will only offer annual guidance from now on
interest expenses dropping 4Q earnings
new sales were down: in line with industry (all other numbers up)
PB 1.2 as of yesterday
working on customer satisfaction (3 day unconditional return policy)
60 days: if it breaks they fix it

calls

5% is the long term margin target
very strict return on invetment guidline.  sells off unprofitable stores
1st and 4th quarter are the slow quarters.
gross profit is determined by "mining for cars"
acquisition pipeline looks similar to past years
always buying (and selling) stores
doesn't seem to be competition for store purchases
Car Max?  competitors?  management claims the market is huge

Car Max == online car seller with physical dealer locations KMX

Company feels well managed and seems set for continued growth.  I'm still bothered by the large executive salaries.  Hold and buy if it gets cheap.

Feb 9, 2006

Talked to Steve about my concern about executive pay.  He said that all large companies pay execs these kinds of salaries and Lithia is a large company.  Most of the other companies I look at are much smaller thus the smaller exec compensation.

Slow (but expected) Q1; growing into Mar.  Increasing inventory for Spring.

conference call (

weak jan improving feb strong march
taking on additional inventories in Q1 for going into stronger spring seasons
cost increases: option related + payroll
PB yesterday 1.4
guidance 2.46 to 2.58 per share for 2006
salesmen will have linked PCs that reduce paperwork; allow tracking of gross sales per customer

Qs

traffic wasn't up but conversion rates were much higher
looking to keep stalls (fixed costs) down
acquisitions looking for small to medium, average performing stores, low dealer per population
)

Still seems a bit undervalued.  I'll pick up a bit more.
