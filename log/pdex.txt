Steve owned this in the past and asked me to look at it.

Rotary drives and motion control (hw+sw) for medical devices and industrial applications.  This is another company that makes a product that I can't evaluate which makes me want to stay away.

Guidance is 0.17 to 0.19 which is still a PE of 13.  This doesn't seem cheap enough for their growth rate.
