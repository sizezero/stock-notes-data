stock dropped on lower jun05 earnings
dec21 Rugby group may sell 5.7M shares.  Not sure what this will do to the stock price.
First and fourth quarter (next two quarters) should be lower due to severe winter weather.

The numbers for this company look great but I can't seem to get over the high executive salaries.  The CEOs salary is eating up over $0.05 EPS.

Losing money for several years but the last two quarters are better.  Extrapolating a full year from the last two quarters. This is a mistake if earnings are seasonal.  10K says these are seasonal.

Non-existent margins but crazy low evaluation.  Worth looking at the last 10K and 10Q.

10K

Distributor of building materials: millwork, wood products, etc. 27 wholesale distribution centers serves 41 states.  Buys from manufacturers; sells to builders.  Performance of the company is closely tied to residential construction.

Lost money since 2007.  In 2007 their revenues were twice as high and they still didn't make money.

I need to see a profitable year before seriously looking at this.  Their margins are so low that they still can't seem to make money as revenue climbs.
