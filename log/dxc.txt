Spun off of shares in HPE. Complicated cost basis but using the average.

TRADE buy 195@55.85 balance 195 commission 0.0

I actually own 195.3457 shares but my program only handles integer share values.

I should really research this one since there will likely be a lot of sell pressure over the next few months to drive the price down.
