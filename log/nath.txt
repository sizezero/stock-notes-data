Stock jumped 50% in the last year.  I don't see what news would have caused that.  

10Q.  Running to catch a plane.  Didn't have time to go over it in detail.

They're still around. I guess they've been in business since 1916 so they must have figured out how to sell a hotdog.

They just filed their 10Q yesterday.

The price really took off in 2012 and have been remarkably volatile in the dozen years since then. The PE is in line with a normal restaurant but isn't cheap.

I don't know if it's worth looking at until it get's really cheap. Let's put low watch on this.

BUY $45
