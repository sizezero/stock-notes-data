Job placement key in continued referrals as well as "an important requirement for continued participation in Title IV Programs...Students attending our schools finance their education through a combination of family contributions, individual resources, private loans and federal financial aid programs. Each of our schools participates in the federal programs of student financial aid authorized under Title IV Programs, which are administered by the DOE. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 80.1% (calculated based on cash receipts) of our revenues were derived from the Title IV Programs"

Revenue decreased by $24.6 million, or 16.1%, to $128.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 from $152.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.  This decrease was primarily attributable to a 20.2% decrease in average student population to 24,711 for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, from 30,965 for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.

The decrease in average student population is due to adjustments in our business model to better align with the Department of Education’s increased emphasis on student outcomes and our efforts to comply with the 90/10 rule.  As part of these measures we have implemented a more selective student enrollment policy to ensure that we enroll students that demonstrate a strong ability to achieve successful student outcomes, including higher graduation rates, repayment rates and lower student debt levels.  We have also restructured certain programs and altered program offerings at some of our campuses which resulted in lower financial aid funding availability and higher student cash contributions during the quarter.  These changes, coupled with the current economic conditions, have resulted in a significant decline in student starts at these campuses. We believe these changes will lead to improvement in our 90/10 ratios and facilitate our compliance with the 90/10 rule.

"""
Changes in the laws applicable to Title IV Programs could reduce our student population, revenues and profit margin.

On April 15, 2011, President Obama signed H.R. 1473, the Full-Year Continuing Resolution which funds the federal government for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year.  This Continuing Resolution, among other things, permanently repeals the year-round Pell Grant beginning with the 2011-2012 award year.  The year-round program had allowed students in accelerated programs to obtain two Pell Grants in a single award year. As a result of the repeal, students may obtain only one Pell Grant per award year.  This change may impact our students’ ability to finance their education and/or affect their decision to attend our institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Financial Checklist
 For company and industry
  5 yr EPS growth. 0.76 to 2.79 = 267% but 50% plumment in latest quarters adjust to 1.33%
  5 yr revenue growth. $299,221 to $639,494 = 114% (similar recent plumment)
  Current net profit margin (earnings/revenue). 69731/639494 = 11%
  Current ROE (earnings/stockholders_equity). 69731/222485 = 31%
  % long term debt to equity. 56508/222485 = 25%

Conclusion: competition and future uncertaintly definitely make this a not-great company.  Current earnings cannot sustain the current dividend but even if the payout is cut in half it would still yield over 5%.  I would like to think the commitment to shareholders would keep some dividend around.  Assume drop in 2010 eps by 50% to $1.40 would still give a crazy low PE of 6.4  It looks like a value trap but I think I may be trapped for $10K more investment.  Definitely not a great company but worth doubling down.

Conclusion: Funny, after a three day weekend the market tanked by a few percent and I had a perfect opportunity to pick up linc for a 5% discount.  I couldn't do it based on the fact that the company depends so heavily on the Title IV programs.  I don't think it's smart to depend on this legislation especially with the deficit at these levels and spending cuts so talked about.

Besides giving back some equity via dividends for five years this company has been a disaster. Even my loss aversion can't hold out any longer.  Sell all of this at market price.
