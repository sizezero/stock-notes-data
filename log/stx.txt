Stock roared back with institutional interest even though estimates are not that great for the year.  Consider getting some money out of this earlier than normal.

PE is crazy low now matter how we look at it.  Let's use yield for valuation since the payout ratio is pretty sustainable.  Back in the truck by is anything more than a 5% yield == price $25.60.  First sell (just to pull some money out) is at 3.5% yield of $36.57.  Full sale would be at 3% of $42.67.

BUY $25.60
SELL $36.57

Let's do a little more due dilligence and read the latest 10Q
