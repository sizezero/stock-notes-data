$100 to $500 MC

Online banking solution provider.  Making money in the last year.
Very low PE for a software company--maybe they are more of a
consulting company?

Dec 13, 2005

Up and down revenue and earnings.  (Loss in the last quarter)

High customer concentration results in chunky earnings.  It looks like it is difficult to sell banking solutions to large customers.  I don't have any real product insight so I'm continuing to stay away from this one.

2009 small cap search

     On May 15, 2007, Corillian Corporation (“Corillian”) and CheckFree Corporation (“CheckFree”) consummated the merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 13, 2007, among Corillian, CheckFree and a wholly owned subsidiary of CheckFree (the “Merger Agreement”). As a result, Corillian became a wholly owned subsidiary of CheckFree. As previously announced, the Merger Agreement was approved by Corillian’s shareholders on April 30, 2007. Upon the closing of the merger, each outstanding share of Corillian common stock, no par value per share, was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $5.15 in cash, without interest. Under Oregon law, holders of Corillian common stock do not have dissenters’ rights with respect to the merger.

Bought by Checkfree which was bought by FISV.

Steady grower even in this market but overvalued as a $7B company with a 20 PE.
