As much as I hate the abuses of intellectual property, this company could easily score big with any of these patents.  Despite the recent plunge in the stock price, it is still not cheap based on the last few quarters.  The company is based on lawsuits and litigation: the 10Q is filled with them.  One suit is from a former CEO of the company.
