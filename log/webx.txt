NAME: WebEX Communications Inc.

Recommended by Steve via Bill Gibson report.

Product is internet web conferencing.  They provide the network so
there is little hardware/software modification required.  Works with a
standard browser.

Meetings are performance critical (like phones) so it will be a while
before a non-service oriented product (MS, open-source) arrives that
can compete with this.

Web conferencing company.  $1B MC makes it difficult for me to accept
such a high multiple (22x) for this company.  Earnings _have_ risen
considerably in the past couple years.

The report states the stock is worth $30 now.
