Investor's podcast had Jesse Felder on today. They talked more about this company and in Dec it finally got cheap enough for some of them to buy. Stig has been talking about this one all the way down but I think the other guys talked him out of it. Some of the interesting things from the show:

- $1B in cash for a $2B MC
  - buybacks would be amazing but they will probably do something more conservative with it
- estimates are good for 2019
- still has more costcutting to do
  - close underperforming stores

It yields a little over 4% now. I could pick up a little and hope for a pullback. On second thought, put a lowball buy in first and hope for a pullback.

BUY $13
