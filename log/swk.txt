Strategy
"""
* Maintaining portfolio transition momentum by continuing diversification toward higher growth, higher profit businesses, increasing relative weighting of emerging markets and opportunistically consolidating the tool industry;
* Being selective and operating in markets where brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation and global cost leadership is achievable;
* Pursuing growth on multiple fronts through building existing growth platforms such as security (both convergent and mechanical) and engineered fastening and growing the more nascent stage infrastructure and healthcare platforms;
* Accelerating progress via SFS (Stanley Fulfillment System: continuous efficiency improvements)

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat

 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs? Brands should have lasting power.

I like the simplicity of the business and the whole company seems to be run fairly efficiently. Pretty pricy for a tool maker although the growth looks good and margins are decent.  Buy some if PE drops to 11.

Reading some articles about debt and reduced margins. The stock has pulled back to a point that it hasn't been in a decade. EPS is the lowest it's been for 10+ years.

With the debt and high payout ratio I suppose I should stay away from this one unless the next couple quarters rebound significantly. I think people are buying the name/reputation so I'll be unlikely to get this thing cheap unless there are a lot of problems.

BUY none
SELL none
