Strategy
"""
* Maintaining portfolio transition momentum by continuing diversification toward higher growth, higher profit businesses, increasing relative weighting of emerging markets and opportunistically consolidating the tool industry;
* Being selective and operating in markets where brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation and global cost leadership is achievable;
* Pursuing growth on multiple fronts through building existing growth platforms such as security (both convergent and mechanical) and engineered fastening and growing the more nascent stage infrastructure and healthcare platforms;
* Accelerating progress via SFS (Stanley Fulfillment System: continuous efficiency improvements)

I like the simplicity of the business and the whole company seems to be run fairly efficiently. Pretty pricy for a tool maker although the growth looks good and margins are decent.  Buy some if PE drops to 11.
