IP related network software.  Based in Israel.

I don't see anything particularly interesting about the product.
Routing, virus blocking, etc.  MC of $330 and PE of 30 will keep me

2009 small cap search

Losing money year after year.  Barely returned to profitability in the last quarter

shares: 19,439,776
eps: 0.20
price: 8.97
==>
PE 44.9
MC $174.4M

Even with expected earnings of 0.05 next quarter it is horribly overvalued.
