New R&D
"""
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect to open a small laboratory facility in San Diego, California.  The facility will be designed for the manufacture of small-scale laboratory projects. The leased laboratory facility is in the process of being identified and will initially be staffed by two newly-hired chemists with experience in the synthesis of small molecules.  We believe that some of the small-scale business generated from this new facility will have the potential to mature into larger drug development projects which can be manufactured in our facility in Albany, Oregon.

Our primary competition is from a variety of fine chemical companies headquartered in Western Europe.  We occasionally encounter competition from developing countries in Asia that have substantially lower cost structures.

Looks interesting.  Mention to Steve.
