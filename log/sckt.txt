Yahoo isn't showing a market cap so I'm not sure the share count is accurate.  (got it from the last 10Q)

=== Mar 2012 10Q

Current assets $5.2M current liabilities $7.3M.  Company believes it has enough cash to operate for another year.

Sells hardware barcode scanners plus software SDKs that allow development on smartphones, tablets, etc.  Touch screen shortages (probably due to iphone) have caused production problems.  38% gross margins.

Competition listed as a risk but they don't list their competitors.

IP lawsuit is noted as a risk.  Aaron Brooks mentioned that being a small player in the mobile market may get you sued into oblivion.

1.5M stock options available.

=== 2012 Q2 conference call

scanner product offers cool bluetooth integrations with phones, tablets, etc.  e.g. use scanner and product shows up on phone or tablet.  Nordstrom uses a more integrated solution.

slowness in addressing the apple iphone impacted profitablity.  $5.4M is where they would break even.  655 and 7Ci have to perform as they have no money for more development.  $5M is feasable for the 3rd quarter.
