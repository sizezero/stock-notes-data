$100 to $500 MC

Natural gas distributor in OR WA.  Flat revenue.  Uneven income, may
be cyclic.  Offers dividend.  Seems like high PE 19 for a utility
company.

Dec 12, 2005

Low executive pay: CEO $142K, CFO $164K

Fairly flat revenue and earnings for each year 02,03,04

Last year looks much worse: negative earnings.

The company is in a regulated industry which may cause problems.  Reasons stated for a poor 2005 from the 10Q are:

"
Primary factors negatively impacting the year-to-date comparisons were:

- Lower 2005 distribution and gas management margins from industrial customers
- Executive and other transition costs in 2005
- Increased uncollectible accounts expense in 2005
- Higher depreciation expense in 2005
- Lower natural gas usage per residential and commercial customer

Partially offsetting the above factors were:

- Favorable comparisons of Oregon earnings sharing adjustments
- Lower employee benefits expenses
- Growth in the number of residential and commercial customers
"

This doesn't look like a company with much upside so I think I'll stay away.
