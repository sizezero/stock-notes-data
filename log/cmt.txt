MC tripled in 18 years. 6%-7% annual growth. Still no dividend. The stock peaked twice in this time at 28 and is now relatively low.

Reading a few seekingalpha articles it seems much of the growth came from acquisitions. The business appears to be cyclical with the price of thermoplastics. I think it might be worth putting this on a watch.
