Press releases in Feb and Mar show new orders for a total of $5.5M.  This seems like small change compared with standard quarterly rev of ~$45M.

Could have gotten this company really cheap 6-12 months ago.  Now it doesn't look like a bargain.  CEO pulls in $600K, rest of management ups this to $1.7M.  This is significant when the company only pulls in $6.1M in profit.
