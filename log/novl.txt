Interesting Barron's article with good things to say.

"""
Laggard in 2009. SUSE linux is the future of the company. $1.6B MC  $1B cash, enterprise value (???) $600M.  Forward PE of 14.  Competitor Red Hat has a PE of 73.  A lift in Enterprise spending could help this year.  Not a sure thing but a good risk/reward.
"""

Excluding oct09 which has a one time $300M hit.  From 10K the write off was "For example, during fiscal 2009 it was determined that $270.0 million of our goodwill, and $5.7 million of PlateSpin’s and $3.4 million of Managed Objects’ developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets were impaired."

On December 14, 2009, we announced a reorganization of our structure and management to better align our business with our strategic objective of becoming an industry leader in the emerging IWM market, while continuing to develop collaboration solutions. These changes are designed to simplify the organization and provide a clear focus on markets that leverage our strengths to capture future opportunities for growth.

As part of this reorganization, effective January 1, 2010, we will consolidate our business unit segments from four to two. Our current Identity and Security Management, Systems and Resource Management and Open Platform Solutions business unit segments will be integrated to create the new Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit. Our current Workgroup business unit segment will be renamed Collaboration Solutions to promote and highlight our recent areas of innovation and the growth opportunity in the collaboration market. The Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit segment should enable us to integrate our product development efforts for identity and security management tools, systems management tools, and our Linux operating system to pursue opportunities in the IWM market. Our Collaboration Solutions business unit segment is structured to enable us to focus our efforts on developing tools for the evolving collaboration market.

After evaluating multiple OS solutions to replace our Solaris systems, SCHARP decided on SUSE linux.
