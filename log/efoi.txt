Designs, manufactures, and markets specialty fiber-optic lighting used for commercial lighting (fast food, retail, hotels) and swimming pools / spas.  Niche market is accent lighting.

Product benefit is a huge reduction in wattage (5 times reduction) as well as lamp replacement reductions (20 times reduction).  Product is has easy pluggable cords into a main base.  Seems to be a little easier than competing products.

Flat revenues for years.  Losses every quarter.

The product makes sense but I can't help but think other companies (GE etc) have similar products.  I'd like to see more proof that these guys are actually capable of selling enough product to make a profit.  It's not clear this company can do it.

Here is a fiber light product from 3M

Somehow this company has managed to lose money every year since 2006 and is still in business.  In spite of this, it had a run up in 2015 after a hint at profitability.

Moved away from consumer products into companies and governement (military)
