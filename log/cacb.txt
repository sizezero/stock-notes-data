NAME: Cascade Bancorp Inc.
CID: 0000865911

Mar 1, 2005

$100 to $500 MC

Holding company for Bank of the Cascades.  Usual increasing revenue
and income.  Dividend offered.  Stock unusually flat.  PE a bit high
at 21.

Dec 7, 2005

Locations: 20 from Ashland to Portland

Y2004 (q1-4): $3,403.00 $3,927.00 $4,123.00 $4,554.00

Very good earnings growth.

trailing earnings (sep05 to dec04) = 6.172 + 4.920 + 4.517 + 4.554 = 20.1M
diluted shares = 17.4M
trailing eps = 1.18
trailing pe @ 23.3 = 19.7

PE has dropped in spite of great earnings.  Still too high for a bank
tho.  Even assuming last quarter continues which would give earnings
of 1.41 the PE would still be 16.

"The Company often experiences strong third quarter deposit flows due
to the seasonal peak of tourism and real-estate transaction activity."
Looks like 3rd quarter was a fluke.  This wasn't the case in 2004 tho.

MC is also a bit mature for my tastes at 394M.

One other warning. The executives are very highly compensated.  CEO
$507K + options.  CFO 251K.  COO $335K + options.

Company is ok.  The are certainly growing well but valuation is still
too high.
