Negative earnings for the life of the company.  Analists projected negative earnings through 2015.  Maybe read the 10K anyway.

Two segments: solar and semiconductor wafers

"""
Our Solar Energy business provides solar energy services that integrate the design, installation, financing, monitoring, operations and maintenance portions of the downstream solar market for our customers. Our Solar Energy business also manufactures polysilicon, silicon wafers and solar modules to support our downstream solar business, as well as for sale to external customers as market conditions dictate. Our Semiconductor Materials business includes the development, production and marketing of semiconductor silicon wafers ranging from 100 millimeter (4 inch) to 300 millimeter (12 inch) as the base material for the production of semiconductor devices.

IPO of semiconductor business as wholy owned subsidiary?  Sep 2013 IPO produced $240M.  Downsizing solar since 2012 due to oversupply.

"""
We provide our downstream customers with a simplified and economical way to purchase renewable energy by delivering solar power under long-term power purchase arrangements with customers or feed-in tariff arrangements with government entities and utilities. Our business is heavily dependent upon government subsidies, including U.S. federal incentive tax credits, state-sponsored energy credits and foreign feed-in tariffs. In certain jurisdictions, the sale of a solar energy system would not be profitable without these incentives. Our customers pay us only for the electricity output generated by the solar energy systems we install on their rooftops, or other property, thereby avoiding the significant capital outlays otherwise usually associated with power plant projects, including typical solar power plants. Once installed, our solar energy systems provide energy savings to customers and enable them to hedge a portion of their energy costs against volatile electricity prices by generating electricity during daylight hours when electricity prices are typically highest.

What happens if subsidies are cut in 2016.  Likely administration change would do that.

Global market.Solar energy 75% of revenues and growing.  Semiconductor actually makes a miniscule profit.
