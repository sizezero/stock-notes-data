I have no experience with neonatal health care.  I have a friend that
used to be a neonatal surgeon.  I'll try to track him down.

Seeing a company steadily increase revenue and income is a great sign

Still growing but a high valuation.  Market cap is too larger for me to ever look at.  How did I hear of this stock anyway?
