$100 to $500 MC

Increasing revenues/earnings util last year. Strange, was not able to
get last earings statement from yahoo: document expired. No dividends.
10Q has still not been reported mar 11 05.  Turnover in management in
Jan 05; seems to be the result of loan losses discovered in the recent
quarter.  Terrible web site.  Can't find total shares outstanding on
any documents.

Seemed overpriced back in March at $19.  Now it's up to 23.  PE of 22
is crazy for a bank.  No dividends so it must be very growth oriented.
There are much better deals out there.  Bought out a smaller bank.

2009 small cap search

Lost $200M in 2008.  Losing money every quarter this year.  Dropped from $20 to $0.50
Fishy balance sheet; not sure if the company's solvent.
