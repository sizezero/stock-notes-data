Steve likes this.  Increasing revenue the last couple years but flat in 2009.  I don't like the fact that the exclusive deal with one type of aircraft locks them into that model.

Strange balance sheet.  Lots of jets give them a negative assets.  They don't have much cash either.

They have done very well in the bad economy compared to their peers such as netjets.
