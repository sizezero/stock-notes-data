The stock is up 700% in the past year.  I can't help but think that a PVC pipe maker can't justify a valuation growth like this.  Could it really have been that undervalued a year ago?

Wait for the 10K to come out to see the earnings breakdown and the possible loss in revenue from selling the subsidiary.  It may be worth it to wait a quarter or two and see how earnings flatten after the exceptional 4th quarter.
