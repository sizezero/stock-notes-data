Low margins but nice PE.  Modest dividend.  Even lowest growth estimates look good.  I also like the fact that there are a lot of untapped markets.

2008 - 2006
Revenue $469,372 $411,318 $358,574

EPS (diluted)  $1.33 $1.17 $1.34

63 Facilities in 6 western states.  Skilled nursing services provide nearly all the revenue.  Each facility is fairly independent but compared and improved with metrics.  Skilled nursing is a local business that needs good personal relationships and community reputation.  Target acquisitions are underperforming facilities that can be improved.

Industry trends: Shift of Patient Care to Lower Cost Alternatives, Significant Acquisition and Consolidation Opportunities, Improving Supply and Demand Balance, Increased Demand Driven by Aging Populations and Increased Life Expectancy.  Long list of competitive advantages: hard to weed out the truth from the optimistic bullshit.  Growth strategy is: leadership training, get higher need patients (attract by focusing on quality), organic growth and operating efficiencies (higher occupancy rates), acquire or construct new facilities. 

67% of expenses are payroll related.  Large variety of governmental regulation.  Medicare + Medicaid makes up 77% of payor sources.  Giant list of risks: government regulation / deregulation seems like the most difficult to deal with.

  Key metrics

% quality revenue mix and % skilled revenue mix (skilled == extra treatment) More or less flat from 2006-2008

Occupancy %.  Flat at 81%

Payor source.  Medicare medicade consistent at 74%

Now at 82 facilities.  WA still at 3.

================

Competitive advantage
 Company Moat
  Brand: Brand could be worth something; not sure if it exists yet
  Switching: somewhat difficult to switch; patients will not want to
  Cost: Labor is the greatest cost; no protection there except stock options
  Protected: no IP with this
 How likely will moat endure over the next 5 yrs?  Not much of a moat.

 What is the biggest risk to the company over the next 5 yrs?  Medicare + Medicade slashes
 Probability of it happening.  August CMS cut payments 11% which caused a crash in all these stocks.  Ensign has a good balance sheet so this may give them more buying opportunities.

Financial Checklist

The reliance on government funding alone keeps this from being a great company.  Still, nursing care will be needed and this company seems like it has the model for growth and quality.  Nearest WA location is in Lynnwood.  Estimates are for less income in 2012 (though still increasing revenue)  Buy PE 8, sell PE 15.
