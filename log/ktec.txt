Earnings bounce all over the place.  I'll have to wait for the 10K for better info.  Stock responded well: up to 13 from 9 in march.

Terrible conference call.  Executives lacked lots of data.  Questions about sitting on a large cash position.  Question concerned with large stock option compensation.

SEC form S-8 lists a huge amount of insider selling.

Not much visibility in the Dec09 10Q.  40% of revenue comes from overseas which can be good.  I'll still stay away.
