Very strange company.  Looks like a holding company of three, semi
related IT consulting/reseller companies.  10K talks about being a
unified IP Telephony company but I don't see that on their web pages.
IP Telephony is hugely competitive.  Tied to Cisco products when Cisco
offers a (somewhat) competing product.

Steve said: Telephony is fragmented.  Looking to acquire other
companies.

Showing at Westergaard conference.

A loss in the third quarter cut the stock price in half.  They are now
selling two smaller business units and concentrating on their Cisco IP
product.  As mentioned earlier, I'm wary of them concentrating so much
on Cisco.  In spite of this, focusing the company sounds good and I'd
still be interested in hearing their story.

Qs: What is the customer value of their Cisco product?  Why do Cisco's
own products not have this functionality.

Custom IP products have yet to generate revenue.  The company is still a service company for installing IP networks for data/voice/video using Cisco's products.

Continuing losses and "all their eggs in one Cisco basket" makes me want to stay out.

Steve wanted me to read the latest analyst's report.  Nothing really new in the report.  Steve looks at the Cisco relationship as an asset and I look at it as a risk.
