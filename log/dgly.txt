Steve likes this digital video security system company.  Sells to police departments.

Advantages:
* profitable in the pre-crash past
* analog to digital will spur upgrades
* insiders buying stock
* decent balance sheet
* management predicts 2010 to be record year

Disadvantages
* weak economy may mean many departments are not spending on infrastructure

I think I got lucky with one small Michigan order and the Ferguson shooting bumping the price.  Time to get out of this issue that I don't want to own.

TODO: add commission data when it becomes available
