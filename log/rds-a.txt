No financial data on Yahoo and SEC data is obscured with foreign 6-K filings.  Shell web site has the most readable information.  Scottrade has the simplest data.

I'll play this as a money machine.  Keep an eye on earnings, yield and payout ratio.

Payout ratio: 41
EPS: 8.45
Gross margin: 20%
Operating margin 11%
PE: 7.9
div (annual) 3.44

quartely div is currently US $0.86.  Scottrade/etrade says $0.43

My calculations of PE look much worse than the presented numbers.  I must be looking at trailing numbers or maybe the wrong currency.  Payout ratio looks unsustainable.  Every other source has a PE of ~7.9.  Maybe my share count is wrong? No.  etrade also lists mc at 125B and shares outstanding at 1.9B.

Well, if I focus on a yield of 5.1% and a payout ratio of 41% then this is probably a good buy.  Oil will continue to fluctuate but this is a good entry point.  Sell at yield of 3% since there is less visibility here.  Buy at a yield of 5%

Same number problems as the previous post. I'll continue to use yield. Sell at yield of 3.5% since there is less visibility here.  Buy at a yield of 7%
