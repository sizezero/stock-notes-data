some kind of stock dividend.  I can't track this down.  Assuming buy price of $0.00 ?  This blows up the program so setting it at $0.01 instead.

No info on yahoo.  Had to get it from the foreign 6K.  Info in Taiwan dollars.  Etrade has some good info.  Rocky earnings history.  Sell as the gains become long term.

Still not much visibility.

Maybe annual visibility is good enough for this company.  With a yield at 3.6% do I really want to sell?  I think I should add this to dollar cost buying next year until the yield drops below 2%

Still hard to get a handle on the finances.  Dividend seems to be the best way to value this.  Current annual dividend is $0.41 per share.  Sell: 2.5% yield $16.40 price/share; buy 5% $8.20 price/share.
