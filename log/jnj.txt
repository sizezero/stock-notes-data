Payout Ratio 64.7%

Good increase in revenue but higher costs due to " ongoing remediation costs in the Consumer OTC business and inventory write-offs due to the restructuring of the Cardiovascular Care business" also health care reform legislation.

Not sure how to value this gigantor of a company.  With that high payout ration they still have a lot of cash to work with but the PE seems way to high for a company this size in this market.  Earnings estimate are over $5 for next year which would significantly drop the PE.  Can't really buy until the PE drops to 10.  Won't sell unless the yield falls to 3%.  These numbers may change significantly after next years numbers.
