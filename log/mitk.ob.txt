The company's most popular product is windows based workstation
software that verifies check signatures.  It has several small banks
in it's success stories and claims some larger institutions (IBM, Bank
of America) as its customers.

Declining revenue and income since 2002.  Just squeaked in with a
profitable jun05 quarter.

They have 11 patents relating to OCR and signature verification and
are active in licencing them for royalties.

It looks like they may have had some legal problems in 2005.  From
their latest earnings press release: "During 2005, we moved quickly to
complete the divestiture of our CheckQuest product line, have resolved
all litigation to the benefit of the Company, and recruited top
management personnel."

Pay and stock of the executives is modest.

Latest earnings dec3
Past 4Qs
458K+230K-798K-918K = -1028K

It looks like they may be on the verge of becoming profitable.

From latest 10-KSB "There were 14,832,337 shares outstanding of the
registrant's Common Stock as of October 19, 2005".  Employee stock
options and debt issuance could further dilute the stock.

If earnings continue as is (no growth), then trailing year earnings in
six months could be 1.5M giving an eps of $0.10 Given a stock price of
$1.2 that would give a PE of 12 which is crazy low for a software
company.

Listened to conference call.  Nov 30, 2005 call for fiscal 4Q 2005
(sep30 2005)

lecture:
divesting unproductive assets in the last 18 months
ceo joined 30 months ago
focusing on high margin software products
gross margins up 63% to 83%
working to eliminate lauris fund debt
markets to community banks and credit unions
installed 10 fraud systems to date
one instance ROI was less than 3 months
approval cycle is long and commitment to new tech is slow
strategic partnership with John H Harland co.
can expand to retail, health care, and homeland security
expect 2006 sales to be higher than 2005

questions:
more than checks
looking for other applications for image verification
ceo really hyping technology
gets royalty on printed checks
gets royalty on decoding algorithms (not yet realized)
hardware devices are a long way out
harlan is a large co. ticker is JH
several new analysts that are following the co--no specifics
ownership (idiot caller; all in 10KSB):
thorton: 19%
lauris: a million in warrants; could have 5-6%
harland: 20% (warrants)
total outstanding shares: 14M (maybe 3 more million)

The one issue that came up for me was the possible extra 3M in
outstanding shares.  That changes the calculations a bit and adjusts
the possible PE from 12 to 15.
