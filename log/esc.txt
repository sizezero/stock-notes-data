$100 to $500 MC

Assisted living company.  Rapidly growing revenues, still in the red.
$20M neglegence jury award in Jan05.  Balance sheet looks horrible.
Why has the stock gone from 6 to 16 in the past year?

I have no idea why this stock is surging (19).  They still can't seem to make money and with an MC of $312M they need some serious earnings to justify that.  Gross profit hit 49M last quarter, if they can continue that then they can hit $200M for the year.  Not sure of margins.

From the 10Q it seems the founders are interested in buying and reselling communities as needed.  It almost seems like a mutual fund of retirement communities.

Still not making money with a $840M market cap.
