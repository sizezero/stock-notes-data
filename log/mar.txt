Barron's had an article where they describe how the company wants to maintain a payout ratio below 30% and use the rest of excess profits for buybacks. Due to this they have managed to grow the dividend greatly.

Increase and yield
May 5,  2017 10% 0.93%
May 6,  2016 20% 1.33%
May 8,  2015 25% 1.34%
May 9,  2014 18% 0.95%
May 10, 2014 31% 1.23%

The problem is that the trailing PE is 40 and the forward PE is 27. The earnings appear to be growing but I can't imagine buying a large hotel chain at these multiples. Keep watching with a buy at half the current price.

BUY $70.00
