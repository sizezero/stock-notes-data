NAME: IPEX

Showing at Edgewater Conference.

I can't seem to get any income statements or balance sheets.  Either
they just went public or they just switched from ipex to ipex.ob and
yahoo hasn't caught up.

An exchange for voip traffic?  I don't know, the last time I heard of
a company trying to do this it was Enron creating and exchange for
internet bandwidth.

I guess the first question I would have for them is "Who is a member
of your exchange?" and "How deeply involved are they?"

ticker is now IPEXE.OB and SEC data is split between two CIDs: 0001258383 and 0001324980

No need to waste time one this.
