Used to print for VistaPrint but relationship went sour.  Mod-Pac is now attempting to compete with VistaPrint in retail via lizardprint.com (under construction).  Last quarter loss is due to severing ties with VistaPrint.  Previous quarter included a buy out fee from VistaPrint.  Box business grew by 33% but very low margins.

"""
The Company expects to achieve positive cash flow for the balance of the year primarily as a result of continued improvement in operating results via growth in sales of its custom folding cartons line and expansion of its market in commercial print.
"""

Wait for next quarter.

It's a new game now that the company has severed it's ties with VistaPrint.  It sounds like a working business model will require a functioning and popular web service.  I mistakenly went to lizardprint.com instead of printlizard.com.  The latter is the actual web site.  It's not a bad site.  Wait for next quarter.
