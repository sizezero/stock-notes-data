$100 to $500 MC

Clothing maker.  Positive earnings the past year.  Seems high priced
for a clothing maker.

Latest Q2 (sep05) disappointing.  I just can't see owning a clothing
maker.  Consumers are just too fickle.

2009 small cap search

On April 12, 2007, Cutter & Buck Inc., a Washington corporation (the “Company”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with New Wave Group AB (Publ), a corporation organized under the laws of Sweden (“New Wave”) and Newport Acquisition Corporation, a Washington corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of New Wave formed for the purpose of entering into the transaction (“Newport”).  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Newport would merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation of the merger (the “Merger”).

Merged into a non-public company.  What should I do with this file?
