$100 to $500 MC

Web advertising company.  Just starting to make money.  Crazy
valuation.

Dec 5, 2005

Stock has backed off a lot (down from 21 to 7) quarter ending sep05
has slightly declining revenue and miniscule (tho not negative)
earnings.

trailing earnings from yahoo = 10K+949K+681K+990K=2.6M
From latest 10Q outstanding shares 6484012
With options and warrants that increases to 7.663M
trailing eps = 0.34
trailing PE @ 7 = 21

Reading 10Q:

acquired Neighbornet in May
Equity financing at $17 per share
Riskless model pays web sites based on advertiser revenue generated.

Changing over to the new model is blamed as a major cause of the
latest earnings.

Price still seems high for an advertising company but it is at least
worth looking at now.

Steve forwarded me a Bill Gibson Report.  Management missed numbers last quarter and the next quarter will be a loser as well.

Something could come of this but there is no need to rush.  I have some insight into this business so if management turns out to be competent, this wouldn't be a bad company to own.
