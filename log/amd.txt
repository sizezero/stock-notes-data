Bought a bit on a whim after Meltdown. This looks datacenters will star 
diversifying more which would give AMD more business.

This thing has turned into a rocket. The product and growth are great
but the price is way beyond the current fundementals. I saw a longs on
seeking alpha discuss this "problem". One investor who bought in 2012
said he was going to hold for at least ten years and only evaluate to
sell when:

1. pc cpu share 40%
2. data center cpu share 20+ %
3. dGPU share 45+%

This seems like a good strategy since continued growth should justify
the multiples.
