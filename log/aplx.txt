From latest earnings release:

Company seems to estimate a flat revenue for 2006 which will then be butchered by stock option compensation:

"""
For 2006, Applix expects to achieve strong top line revenue growth, targeting total revenues of $41-$44 million and license revenues of $22-$23.5 million. Lastly, Applix is targeting diluted earnings per share on an annual basis between $0.17-$0.27, based upon an estimated effective tax rate of 13% and an assumed weighted average number of diluted shares of 17,000,000. The Company's forecast for annual earnings per share includes stock compensation expense related to stock options, which is estimated to be approximately $2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in 2006, but does not reflect the impact of foreign exchange, which cannot be predicted.
"""

I see no reason to buy the stock now when the company predicts a dud year.
