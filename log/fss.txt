Sweeper brand Elgin is market leader.  Lot's of other brands.  Claims security products are market leaders as well.

Seasonality: first quarter sucks.

Dividend only came back in 2014

Ferociously paying down debt.

"reduced demand for our products in oil and gas markets"

Good share buybacks.

"Historically, 60% or more of our domestic net sales were derived from municipal and other government markets" Looking to break into private markets including oil and gas.  Could provide a catalyst when oil recovers.

Roughly 70% of sales are environmental group.

Pension plans will be fully frozen by 2016.  Estimates for pension payouts are $8.4M in 2016 peaking at $11M in 2020-2025

Good conference call slides.

================

Calc annualized 5 year eps growth: negative EPS 2010-2012 makes this suspect. Corresponds with cut dividend.

Morningstar key ratios:

Book Value per Share: 3.56
2015

Calc annualized 5 year book value growth + divy: 13.7%

Compare these numbers to 10 year note (1.9%) and each other.

Great company?  I really like the shareholder focus.  Need to do more research and see what happened a few years ago.
