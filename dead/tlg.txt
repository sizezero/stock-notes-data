Not much discussion in the 10Q.  I need to listen to the recent conference call.  The multiple isn't low unless you believe the guidance of 70-110% net income growth for 2006 with only 12-14% revenue growth.  I don't like the business: it seems like they could be squeezed by either the shippers or their customers.
