Seems to have crashed with reduced rev/inc the last two quarters.  This looks like quarterly panic when the company has very strong year over year earnings.  Still, it's high tech and I need to make sure there consistent demand for the products.

Even after reading a few SEC filings, I'm still not sure what happened to this company. It delisted in 2022.

It looks like they bought an ice cream store out of bankruptcy during Covid. It was completely different than anything else the company was doing. Maybe that contributed to their eventual failure.
