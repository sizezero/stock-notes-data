Reading the latest 10Q, it looks like their retail segment is doing well but they are getting hammered on toxic real-estate assets.  Their strategy is to get rid of everything outside of their core business.  Key number seems to be $24B in mortgage loans down from $30B in 2007.  Cash is up $3.8B from $1.7B.  Cash flow good.
