Increasing revenue for 3 years but declining operating income.

Video game controller market is very fickle.  You only hit a homerun
when a large manufacturer really screws up.  e.g. The original xbox
had very large controllers which were uncomfortable for people with
small hands.  3rd parties made some good money making smaller
controllers until ms started shipping smaller controllers.  Most
people won't need to buy other controllers.

iPod accessories could be good.  Digital music players are huge now.

Seasonality
We generate a substantial percentage of our net sales in the last three months of every calendar year, our fiscal third quarter. Our quarterly results of operations can be expected to fluctuate significantly in the future, as a result of many factors, including: seasonal influences on our sales; unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends; the introduction of new video game platforms; the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season; and timing of introductions of new products. See further discussion under “Net Sales” below.

The company is pretty cheap right now.  If their products are any good then they will have an opportunity when the next wave of consoles comes out and the xbox360 gets decent games.

When the new consoles come out, check out game stop to see how the products are selling.
