$292K dividends are paid on preferred stock.  Sucks to be a normal shareholder.  Share data is screwy.  10Q says there are less than a million shares outstanding but yahoo MC shows 5 times the number of shares.

Post hurricane gulf coast looks lucrative.

Still too immature for me.  Watch for improving revenue/earnings.

Dad talked with the company and has done a lot of work.  The company is looking for 12M rev this year, 24M next year.  Hopes to be profitable next year.  Their product is currently in a tiny portion of the construction market so construction lull should not harm their business.  Maybe it's time to buy a little.
