ok. Could be a turnaround?

Still losing money but revenue is up the last quarter
(sep05 to dec04)
rev: 26,781  	24,753  	24,379  	22,295
inc: ($4,228)	($6,217)	($5,120)	($4,498)
MC $127M

from 10Q:
seasonality is in effect with this company.  Q4 should be less that Q3.  Last year cash went from $51.8M to $33.4M

No hurry on this one.  I don't see the big long term story with this co.

I Read a research report by Bill Gibson.  The optimistic buzz is that cost cutting combined with states adopting Real ID will result in profitability.

"""
President Bush has signed the REAL ID bill
into law, which will compel states to issue
more robust driver’s licenses by 2008. Many
state DMV commissioners have balked at this
unfunded mandate, so the law may still be
modified. Even though timetables and
parameters may be altered in the REAL ID act,
we are convinced that this market will
eventually prove to be a significant driver’s of
revenue and profit growth for these vendors.
"""

This sounds like a big gamble.  I wouldn't bet on it unless I had some information on the purchasing plans of a large DMV such as CA or TX.  The fact that they've lost money up to now in spite of having a steady revenue stream leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  It's taken this long to finally cut costs?

Of course the company is really cheap: trading at 1.0X sales and 1.16 PB.  The next quarter is not supposed to be good so there is plenty of time to watch.
