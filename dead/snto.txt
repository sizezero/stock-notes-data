Steve was pointed to this company by a trader.

The company offers a product called "Right Channeling".  The general function of the product is to handle customer support for a company.  The specific advantages of the product is that it allows either the company or the customer or both to customize the way that the client receives support.  This includes: voice, email, chat, forums and knowledgebase.  There can also be different options for paid support and free support.

This product is similar to the one made by Onyx Software ONXS

If this is indicative of their earnings then this is pretty cheap especially for a software company.  I'm not sure how much support their product requires so they may be closer to a consulting company margin-wise.  Considering the past valuations of Onyx, this seems like a deal as long as the last two quarters are not extraordinary for some reason.
