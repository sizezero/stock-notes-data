Do not get this confused with WCBO: also a local bank.  Actual bank is
"Whidbey Island Bank".  13 branches on Whidbey Island and several
counties north of Seattle.  Reduced operating income off of increasing
revenues.

earnings press release:

Still growing.  Opened a branch in Jan and will open another couple branches this year.

Claims basic banking: "We posted record profits in 2005 by focusing on basic banking: building a high-quality loan portfolio and using core deposits as a primary funding source," stated Michal Cann, President and CEO. "We have also benefited from a strong local economy, a growing population, and relatively low long-term interest rates. This environment, combined with our focus on relationship banking, has allowed us to expand our net interest margin while maintaining exceptional credit quality."

Since real-estate may be declining, I'd have to buy this at a greater discount.
