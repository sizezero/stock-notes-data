11 States; 1000 Customers.  Some growth is via acquisitions.

Strategy has several components:
1) expand power generation sales in existing territories
2) expand to other territories (western us)
3) expand power maintenance
4) expand renewable energy business
5) expand energy efficiency programs
6) expand demand response (like ecng.ob)
7) increase sales of energy measurment/management solutions
8) capitalize on new energy legislation

This is a lot of stuff but it gives them a shotgun approach to focus on whatever is profitable.

FY 2010 expect rev 17M-25M.  Steve expects 20M to 22M.  2011 expect rev 40M-45M.  Steve's trying to buy some.  I should buy $10K.  Steve thinks they should be profitable the second half of the year.
