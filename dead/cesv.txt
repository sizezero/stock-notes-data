I'm terrified of investing in a Chinese company but these numbers look great.  Home page seems investor centric but that's probably due to sales through the subsidiaries.

There's a pretty negative motley fool article on this company that posits that the company can't grow/compete without a huge cash infusion.

Most of the board resigned.  Stock delisted.  No info on what happened.  Continue to be terrified by chinese companies.
