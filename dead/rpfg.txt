$100 to $500 MC

Holding company for Rainier Pacific Bank.  Only recently profitable.
Bad trailing valuation but I should compare it to the other holding
companies.  Decent growth in each of the last four quarters.

Increasing revenues; company has only been public for a couple years

Declining revenues and poor earnings.  Acquiring insurance agencies for some reason.  The bank offers insurance and stock services.

I'm not sure what's keeping the stock up.  Equity has been declining.  Seems stupid for this company to be giving out dividends.
