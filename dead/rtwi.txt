"""
This was another excellent quarter for us despite the continuing pressure on insurance pricing," said Jeff Murphy, RTW's President and CEO. "Competitors continue to price policies well below what we believe are acceptable rates. We continued to execute our plan of growing service business through our Absentia(SM) service division which presents significant growth and profit potential for the company. Further, Absentia provides us the flexibility to decline writing inappropriately priced business, maintaining profitability in our insurance operations.
"""

CEO feels competitors are pricing themselves too low and opening themselves up to greater liability in the future.  Expects a decline in premiums for the next quarter as well.
