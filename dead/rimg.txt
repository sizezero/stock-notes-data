From latest earnings release:
During the coming year, Rimage expects to invest more than $4 million on implementing an enterprise resource planning system, of which approximately $2 million will be capitalized, that will significantly strengthen its ability to manage anticipated growth over the next few years. Implementing this system will have a nominal impact on Rimage's profitability in the first quarter of 2006, but the pace of investment will ramp up in the second quarter.

Watch this for price contraction to 16 or improved earnings.

Not sure why the stock is up off these earnings.  I really like the products but I'm not sure if the company/management is good.

Fund manager on Rimage:

Martindale also points to Minneapolis, Minn.-based Rimage Corp.  , which makes tools for publishing, duplicating and printing CDs and DVDs.

"They do that for many businesses that are interested in storing recorded information in a venue that is long-lasting, off the network," Martindale said.

Martindale said he's optimistic about the company's product lineup and strategy.

Rimage is moving into retail, with products aimed at consumers who want to store photos and other information on CDs and DVDs. "They have a strong program going with Wal-Mart and they expect to land other drugstore chains," he said.
"They're not a fully mature public company," he added about Rimage. "They invest for what they think is the right thing for the company and the future. They're a little less sensitive to the needs of Wall Street, of meeting current expectations. It has created a little bit of volatility around the stock, but nonetheless they have $7 a share in cash and no debt, so they're a very powerful company financially."

Rimage represents about 2% of the fund's assets. Shares of the company lost 29 cents to close at $20.66 on Tuesday.
