From Motley Fool article:
Brooks, CEO of DHB Industries (AMEX: DHB). In just the first 10 (google) results, we find out that Brooks tends to sell his DHB shares, recently threw his daughter a $10 million bat mitzvah, and is referred to frequently as a "corporate crook." I'd call those red flags.

Motley fool often uses DHB as an example of a disastrously managed company:

The above interesting article had some screens struggling companies for potential value investments:
1) Look for greedy execs.  You can find this in DEF 14A
2) Running on fumes.  For huring companies, pay more attention to cash flow than earnings.
3) Disappearance test: if the company vanished tomorrow, would anyone care?

10Q

horrendous sep05 quarter was due to a $60M vest replacement charge.
"The cost of the vest replacement program is a separate
line item under selling, general and administrative expenses, for a total
pre-tax charge of $60,000,000, or ($0.76) per diluted share after tax charge, as
a result of the Company's voluntary Zylon(R) vest replacement program announced
in August 2005."

Company CEO appears to be a crook by any measure.

It looks like they went out of business in 2011. This is after an SEC investigation.
