The ticker has evaporated so the buyout apparently completed.  The company is now private.

I'm not sure what to do with these dead entries.  Delete the file?

OK, I'm going to make a "dead" directory and move these there.  Use this for companies who's ticker has evaporated.  If a company was bought out then I have the choice of merging this log with that of the buyer's log.
