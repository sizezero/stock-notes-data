Earnings positive the last year.  Stock flat but still probably
overpriced.

MC:72M

From 1Q 2005 10Q:

Produces power semicondoctors which are used in aircraft, MRIs,
network base stations and many other products.  Specializes in high
power (> 1 watt) high speed devices.

Been acquiring other companies since 2002.

Latest quarter earnings -$6.3M.  This is mostly due to the acquisition
of PowerSicel, but also lower wafer yields, and greater than average
product returns.  Management claims these problems are fixed and are
only a singular occurence.  Check in on them next quarter.

Co believes increased demand may result from customer demand for more
efficient energy use. (energy play)
