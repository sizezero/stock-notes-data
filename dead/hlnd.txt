Natural gas pipelines, cleanup, delivery.  Bad last couple quarters but good growth before that.

The last earnings report was sometime in 2009 but the ticker is still getting cryptic SEC postings about "Kinder Morgan" interest due on notes.

I think the ticker went from HIND to KMI. I'm going to call this dead.
