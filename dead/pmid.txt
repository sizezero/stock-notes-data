Pretty good beer but nothing special.  Consistently losing money,
using up cash.

< $50M MC

Jan 10, 2006

Two miniscule but positive quarters nearly doubled the stock.
shares 8.8M diluted 9.2M
MC @2.35 = 20.7M diluted 21.6M

Balance sheet is a bit shakey.  Current assests $5,652M are still less than current liabilities $6,782M although this is less than it was a year ago.

rev: 13,527  	12,463  	10,457  	10,588
inc: 439  	168  	(1,131)	(1,459)

trailing inc based on last two quarters: 1214
diluted eps: 0.07
PE@2.35 = 33.6

trailing inc based on last quarter: 1756
diluted eps: 0.08
PE@2.35 = 29.3

This could be a turnaround but the price is still taking huge growth into account.

PE:20, eps:0.07 ==> price 1.4
This is lower than the stock has been in a year.  Not worth even adding this to a watch list.

2008 acquired by Independent Brewers United for cash.
