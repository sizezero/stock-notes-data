dec04 quarter had a huge income boost from a tax refund.  dec05 quarter all came from operating income.  Offers a dividend that gives over 4% yield at the current price: sign of responsible management.

10Q

Management expects large fluctuations on a quarter by quarter basis as IT spending is fickle.  No forward looking statements.

I really like the way the management has found ways to make money in this tough business; but I would expect a much lower valuation for a business this volatile.  They also have the problem of being squeezed between software makers and customers.  Combine this with my general pessimism on the future of selling software and this looks like a difficult proposition.  I suppose selling software tools may be a longer lived business.

It looks like this company changed to TechXtend and then Grey Matter in 2022. There may have been more companies in there. Grey Matter is part of the Wayside Technology Group ticker PYA.MU. No earnings, no market cap. I'm going to call this dead.
