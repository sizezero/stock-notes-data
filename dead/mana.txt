Showing at Edgewater Conference.

Sells tax collecting software to the government.  Selling to the
government seems like a risky proposition to me but maybe there is a
story here.  What is their growth plan. e.g. which municipalities are
using their software, which are planning to resubscribe, what are the
new municipalities that they are targeting?

Hey, they're making money.  I'd be surprised if their growth can
justify their ~65 PE.

Losing money on flat revenues.  34M MC.  Some contracts were pushed out which resulted in lost revenue.

I still don't like the story and no income makes it worse.
