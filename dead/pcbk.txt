trailing eps (diluted) 1.00
PE @ 15.89 = 15.89

PE is a little higher than the other banks I own (TSBK,FMSB,CASB: 12 to 14)
The growth potential in being able to expand from Eugene to Seattle seems like it might be worth it.

"During the first quarter, we achieved a number of important milestones including the full operational and systems integration of Northwest Business Bank, enabling Pacific Continental to recognize cost savings and efficiencies earlier than was first expected," said Hal Brown, President and CEO of Pacific Continental Corporation. "With the successful integration behind us, we were then able to accelerate our planned expansion into the Vancouver, Washington market by announcing a downtown office location scheduled to open later this spring," added Brown.

Purchased for $644M. Analysis think this was a high price. I wouldn't have lost my shirt on this if I had held onto it but it still wouldn't have been a good investment.
