Seems to have had problems with their billing system.  Reeks of incompetence.

10Q
Accelerated vesting of stock options.
Huge government regulation in the healthcare industry.

The company has spent a lot of money on infrastructure: medical complex in Nevada and expansion of Detroit medical center.  I'd rather wait to see if this spending actually turns into earnings.
