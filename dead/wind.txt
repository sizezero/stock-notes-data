Resells an embedded version of linux.  Slashdot story here:

Targeting phones; teaming with PalmSource.  Could be a big market.
Billion dollar market cap and just barely turning a profit this year.
From the slashdot discussion it seems they can't charge for their
modded kernel, just the dev tools and docs.  I can't see this business
plan ever worth $1B.

Interesting article on the embedded market.  Discusses Linux and it's large footprint, the open source TRON standard, and various commercial alternatives.

Slowly getting profitable via cost cutting.  Company missed Jan numbers: shares plunged.

Bought by Intel in 2009 for $11.50 per share. I'm not sure if there were splits since 2006. This was nearly $1B dollars.
