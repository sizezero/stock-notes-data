Red Lion and West Coast hotels.  Up and down earnings.

Jan 13, 2006

Revenues rebounding but costs may be getting out of hand. sep05 to dec04
rev: 47,215  	44,300  	35,392  	16,589 
gross profit: 7,634  	11,699  	2,666  	(1,089)
inc: $6,756  	$1,733  	($3,123)	($8,240)

It looks like they're selling some less profitable hotels in order to revitalize the rest.  Much of the recent earnings could be one time.

inc: $2,811 (income from continuing operations last quarter--assuming 4 quarters of this)
shares 13,445K (diluted)
price 8.93
==>
Income $11.2M
EPS $0.84
PE 10.7
MC $120.1M

Stock ballooned a bit after the good november quarter but backed off a bit maybe due to Jan effect.

10Q

Claims a gain of $5.6M from sales of discontinued ops.  Perhaps the income figure used above is incorrect.  Claims net gain was $2.7M

3Q 2005 Conference call

expansion plans for other states
some rooms were out of service last quarter--revpar was not adjusted
expect expenses to increase the next few quarters
sold 10 of the 12 hotels identified for disposition
renovations 70% complete of the 3 hotels started in the second quarter
rennovations should be completed for peak summer season
"compressed booking window" group rooms are no longer booked far in advance
acquisition will be conversions, not new buildings
expanding to markets that recognize the red lion brand name: Minneapolis is important
