Showing at Westergaard conference.

Produces flexible, non-silicon, solar cells.  Huge run up in the past
year but still a low market cap of $74M.  Biggest questions: who are
their customers and when do they expect to be profitable.

Still losing money off of flat, miniscule revenues.  MC $88M

This is a very strange disolution of the company. The last 10Q shows zero revenue for 2011 and 2012 and it took until 2018 for the SEC to revoke their registration. I guess this is what happens when it does not come from the company.
