Claims more pros are using clubs with their shafts (e.g. brilliant pink shaft used by Paula Creamer) and that is contributing to their growth.

Trailing PE of 13 seems like a really small multiple for a company that is growing at this rate.  

Small dividend (current yield <2% is nice)

I can't figure out what happened to this company. They issued a 10Q that doesn't mention any catastrophic problems just before they delisted in 2010.
