Showing at Westergaard conference.

IP over power lines.  It's an interesting idea that has never
succeeded.  My question to these guys is what would it take for them
to be profitable?  How big was the Best Western contract announced on

CFO resigned in June.

Changed ticker from TKO to TKOI OTC.

The last filing was March of 2024 with no filings since then. I'm not sure if the number of shareholders allowed them to go private or if they just imploded. Dead either way.
