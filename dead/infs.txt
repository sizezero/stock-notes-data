$100 to $500 MC

Projector systems.  Reducing revenue and horrible losses but making a
little money in the recent quarters.  Latest income result of
securities sales.

Dec 19, 2005

Declining revenues in each of the last quarters culminated in a monster loss in the last sep05 quarter.
rev 130,321  	135,832  	137,016  	179,080 
inc (38,330)	(19,570)	(13,979)	9,876

Executive pay seems high.  CEO $565K, CFO $396K

Lot's of cost cutting.  Removing some executive positions.  Getting out of the thin displays market.

The major dip in the last quarter seems to be blamed on several one time occurances all related to restructuring to get away from flextronics.

"We believe that these actions will enable us to achieve our target gross margin range of 16% to 18% in the first half of 2006."

Shares outstanding: 39.6M (actual and diluted)

With quarter rev of 130M (average last 3 quarters) and gross margins of 17% we would have an annual gross profit of 88M.  Assuming operating expenses of 30M that would give us an operating income of 58M.  If we net appoximately that then:
eps 1.46
PE @ 4 = 2.7

I must be wrong somewhere.  The company is changing their business a bit and if they can sell anything, the stock looks like a bargain.
