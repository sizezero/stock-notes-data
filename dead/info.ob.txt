Dec 19, 2005

Continuing sliding revenues and negative earnings through sep05.  Stock slid from 1.5 to 0.5 since March.  Not sure why the COO is earning $450K.  Jul/Aug company repurchased shares at 0.84 and 0.77.  This is before the oct loss of the Nextel contract.

The balance sheet is still great.  43M in current assets (28M cash) and 16M in total liabilities.  This company has a market cap of $10M.  The cash - total liabilities alone is greater than the market cap.

The business is terrible.  Why not liquidate the sucker?  What am I missing?  Do companies often continue to burn through cash because they can't admit their business is a failure?

After severe losses, sold to Melissa Data Corporation (MD) in 2008.
