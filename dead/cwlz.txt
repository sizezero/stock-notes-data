NAME: Cowlitz Bancorporation
CID: 0000894267

Mar 1, 2005

$50 to $100 MC

Holding co for Cowlitz Bank.  Reduced revenue, staying alive with cost
cutting.  3Q negative earnings may be due to restructuring charge of
earlier acquisitions.  Keep watching.

Mar 7, 2005

Consolidating resources into commercial banking.  4 Cowlitz banks in
SW WA; 2 Bay bank locations in Bellevue and Portland

Declining revenues but also reducing cost of revenues.  Bad PE:23 but
MC:46M and PB:1.3 is very good.

PERIOD ENDING	31-Dec-04	31-Dec-03	31-Dec-02
Total Revenue	18,081  	25,710  	34,045  
Cost of Revenue	2,858		4,258		7,634  
Gross Profit	15,223  	21,452  	26,411
Net Income	1,940		117		1,496  

Can't bring myself to buy into that PE.  Earnings are everything.
Increasing revenue would be a good sign.  Each of the last four
quarters were $4.4M to $4.7M in revenue.

Need avg revenue of $7M+ to get back to revenue of a couple years ago.
Price would have to halve $5.5 in order to make this a buy.

Apr 22, 2005

Just reported increased revenues (beats last 4 quarters) and further
increased earnings

fully diluted eps = ((642+587+517+439)*1000 ) / 4309767.0 
EPS:0.51 P:11.27 PE:22 

Horrible press release.  Revenue for the quarter is not stated.

10K

The 10K is filled with so much whiny risk factors such as: Sarbanes Oxley, various banking regulations, and even the Patriot Act.  None of the other local banks whine about this (except for Sarbanes Oxley) it makes me wonder if management is incompetent and preparing for failure.

Stock options and no dividends seems to be a bad priority for a small bank.

On October 31, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of AEA Bancshares, Inc.  (AEA)  Purchase included cash and shares.  Single Seattle branch.

Equity is about $44M which is closing in on the MC.  Still, earnings are everything and the valuation is way too high for a local bank.  Watch and see how the acquisition treats them.

Went bankrupt in 2010. The ticker kept living until 2014.
