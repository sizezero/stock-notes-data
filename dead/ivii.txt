I agree with most of the risks enumerated.  IP problems could be serious (MPEG, DVD-CSS)

They're really just milking WinDVD.  There are so many alternatives to this software. (mythtv is one) The company does not appear to have done a good job with turning revenue into income.

This company is gone and without a CID I can't track down what happened to it.

I found a wikipedia article that said it was acquired by Ulead Systems for $68M in July 2006. It lost half its value in a year.
