Infomercial company.  Never made money.  Going downhill.

< $50M MC

Dec 16, 2005

Minuscule revenue and earnings (but positive) in 2005.

MC of 6.91M and a PE of 14.  They made a small amount of money in each of the last 4 quarters.  I'm not used to seeing a company this small actually profitable.

Their balance sheet is terrible.  Current assets (minus inventory) of $465 and current liabilities of $847.  I'm not sure how they can operate with so much deficit.

10M shares outstanding.  1M stock options have been offered to date with an average price of $0.49.

"""
In  an effort to reach profitability and become less dependent on the
requirement  to  finance  continuing  operations,  we  are  working  to increase
revenues  and  profit  margins by continuing the trend of generating revenues by
selling  our own products where our margins are much higher than our third-party
products.  Furthermore, we are actively pursuing additional financing so that we
may  produce  two long-form infomercials and one short-form infomercial over the
course of the next twelve months. We have no binding commitments or arrangements
for  additional financing, and there is no assurance that our management will be
able to obtain any additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
"""

The plan for the company is to use infomercials to sell their own products but they also sell other products at a lower margin.
