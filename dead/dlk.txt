Steve asked me to take a look at this company.

The company specializes in wireless communication which takes the form
of software plug-ins to various business applications.  The company
seems like a consulting firm but their product seems like a very, very
niche product.  A larger software solution firm may just as likely
build the wireless functionality into their products as license/buy
them from this company.

I'd like to see some customer testimonials.  I couldn't find any on
the web site.

Showing at Edgewater Conference.

My opinion hasn't changed.  I'd still like to see some customer
testimonials.

I guess they've moved from Santa Barbara to Los Gatos?

It looks like they're thin on cash.

Steve sent me some kind of hype sheet about the stock.  In the flyer are the comments: "This publication is an advertisment on behalf on Semotus Solutions, Inc and may not be construed as investment advice."  Yes, the typo was in the the original.

Still no customer testimonials.
